Specifically, it assesses potential opportunities and\\\\n            challenges of improving digital government and open data\\\\n            initiatives in the country. Although DGRA and ODRA are two\\\\n            separate assessments with different dimensions evaluated,\\\\n            they take a similar methodological approach from a broader\\\\n            point of view, starting with the desk research and later\\\\n            expanding to scoping mission. Therefore, both chapters of\\\\n            DGRA and ODRA are similar in format but outlined in\\\\n            respective assessment dimension and individual indicators.\\\\n            Since its onset in the fall of 2017, intensive desk research\\\\n            was conducted, and a field mission was carried out to\\\\n            confirm preliminary findings and uncover additional insight\\\\n            during a specific period in time, which means that during\\\\n            the course of analysis and writing additional developments\\\\n            could have been made. This is similar to the United Nations\\\\n            global e-government development report, which assesses\\\\n            progress during a \\xe2\\x80\\x9csnapshot\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in time.DGRA, the first part of\\\\n            the report, aims to evaluate Vietnam\\xe2\\x80\\x99s current potential for\\\\n            digital government development across seven key dimensions\\\\n            of leadership and governance; user focus; business process\\\\n            change; capabilities; culture and skills; shared\\\\n            infrastructure; data driven; and cybersecurity, privacy and\\\\n            resilience. Meanwhile, ODRA assesses Vietnam\\xe2\\x80\\x99s open data\\\\n            policy through evaluating eight different dimensions of\\\\n            leadership; policy/legal framework; institutional structure;\\\\n            data within government; demand; citizen engagement; funding;\\\\n            and infrastructure.The DGRA chapter focuses on digital\\\\n            government, which is a core part of Digital Economy as\\\\n            public sector delivers information and services more\\\\n            effectively and make them accessible to its citizens.The\\\\n            DGRA also measures the citizen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s demand for digital\\\\n            government services as well as integration and\\\\n            infrastructure policies to delve deeper into the\\\\n            opportunities and challenges the country faces in its\\\\n            digital development journey. The assessment includes a\\\\n            step-by-step analysis of specific components of digital\\\\n            government and presents an action plan to address the\\\\n            challenges identified for improvement.ODRA, the second part\\\\n            of the report, focuses on the country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s open data policy.\\\\n            Open data refers that the data must be both legally and\\\\n            technically open to public, thus placed in the public domain\\\\n            or under liberal terms of use with minimal restrictions, and\\\\n            that the data is published in machine-readable and\\\\n            preferably in non-proprietary electronic formats, which\\\\n            enables everyone to access and use data with freely\\\\n            available software tools.This report, bringing DGRA and ODRA\\\\n            assessments altogether, aims to help raise awareness of\\\\n            digital government and open data, two critical topics as\\\\n            Vietnam prepares its next step for the fourth industrial\\\\n            revolution (Industry 4.0). Further, it hopes to serve as a\\\\n            useful resource for the top government leadership in\\\\n            identifying areas of relative strengths and weaknesses to\\\\n            help improve digital government and open data at the same time.\"},\"geo_reg_key\":\"517198,517191\",\"repnme\":{\"repnme\":\"Digital Government and Open Data Readiness Assessment\"},\"display_title\":\"Digital Government and Open Data\\\\n            Readiness Assessment\",\"disclosure_date\":\"2019-10-01T00:00:00Z\",\"disclosure_type\":\"NA\",\"pdfurl\":\"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/311651553511049630/pdf/Digital-Government-and-Open-Data-Readiness-Assessment.pdf\",\"txturl\":\"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/311651553511049630/text/Digital-Government-and-Open-Data-Readiness-Assessment.txt\",\"listing_relative_url\":\"/research/2019/02/30920848/digital-government-open-data-readiness-assessment\",\"url_friendly_title\":\"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/311651553511049630/Digital-Government-and-Open-Data-Readiness-Assessment\",\"new_url\":\"2019/02/30920848/Digital-Government-and-Open-Data-Readiness-Assessment\",\"ext_pub_date\":\"2019-10-01T00:00:00Z\",\"disclstat\":\"Disclosed\",\"topicv3\":\"Digital Government m1325964 678,e-Government m1326105 2358,Education, Skills Development and Labor\\\\n            Market m1326135 1484,Open Data Policy m1326174 679,ICT Security m1326856 670\",\"docm_id\":\"090224b08716c925\",\"chronical_docm_id\":\"090224b086abe73f\",\"publishtoextweb_dt\":\"2019-10-01T00:00:00Z\",\"totvolnb\":\"1\",\"versiontyp\":\"Revised\",\"versiontyp_key\":\"1309936\",\"historic_topic\":\"Governance,Public Sector Development,Information and Communication Technologies\",\"projectid\":\"P164025\",\"guid\":\"311651553511049630\",\"origu\":\"Indicators and Data Services (DECIS)\",\"no_of_pages\":\"218\",\"author_keys\":{\"0\":{\"author_key\":\"1578377\"},\"1\":{\"author_key\":\"1473774\"},\"2\":{\"author_key\":\"1172793\"},\"3\":{\"author_key\":\"1334095\"},\"4\":{\"author_key\":\"436890\"}},\"available_in\":\"Vietnamese,English\",\"fullavailablein\":[{\"lang\":\"Vietnamese\",\"entityid\":\"248821570454121344\",\"node_id\":\"30920848\"}],\"url\":\"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/311651553511049630/Digital-Government-and-Open-Data-Readiness-Assessment\"},\"D30920835\":{\"id\":\"30920835\",\"geo_region_mdks\":{\"0\":{\"geo_region_mdk\":\"Southeast Asia!$!Southeast Asia\"},\"1\":{\"geo_region_mdk\":\"World!$!517191\"},\"2\":{\"geo_region_mdk\":\"Asia!$!517198\"}},\"admreg\":\"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific\",\"admreg_key\":\"119225,119225\",\"count\":\"Vietnam\",\"count_key\":\"82695\",\"docna\":{\"0\":{\"docna\":\"Summary Note on Digital Government and Open\\\\n            Data Readiness Assessment\"}},\"docty\":\"Report\",\"docty_key\":\"540664\",\"owner\":\"Indicators and Data Services (DECIS)\",\"projn\":\"VN-Open Data Technical Assistance For\\\\n            Digital Vietnam -- P164025\",\"trustfund\":\"TF0A5182-Open Data Technical Assistance\\\\n            for Digital Vietnam,TF0A6482-Vietnam: Digital Government\\\\n            Implementation of Cloud-Based G2C Services\",\"trustfund_key\":\"1575667,1615326\",\"prdln\":\"Advisory Services & Analytics\",\"prdln_key\":\"1416466\",\"seccl\":\"Public\",\"lang\":\"English\",\"lang_key\":\"120701\",\"entityids\":{\"entityid\":\"090224b086abe55b_1_0\"},\"subtopic\":\"ICT Policy and Strategies,ICT Legal and Regulatory Framework,ICT Applications,E-Government,Information Technology\",\"subtopic_key\":\"672821,672819,672822,672705,672817\",\"teratopic\":\"Information and Communication Technologies,Governance\",\"teratopic_key\":\"644292,644283\",\"repnb\":\"135526\",\"docdt\":\"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z\",\"datestored\":\"2019-03-25T00:00:00Z\",\"keywd\":{\"0\":{\"keywd\":\"Open Data;

Governments must customize their digital\\\\n            strategies to fit their unique environment and needs.report\\\\n            is intended to help the Government of Vietnam assess their\\\\n            digital environments and frame their own strategies. The\\\\n            report contains two themes of Digital Government Readiness\\\\n            Assessment (DGRA) and Open Data Readiness Assessment\\\\n            (ODRA),Digital Government Readiness Assessment, the first\\\\n            part of the report evaluates Vietnam\\xe2\\x80\\x99s current potential for\\\\n            digital government (d-Government) development.The DGRA\\\\n            chapter focuses on d-Government, since the public sector\\\\n            delivers to citizens information and services. According to\\\\n            the biennial United Nations E-Government Development Index\\\\n            (EGDI), governments providing services via digital platforms\\\\n            (such as: Australia, Singapore, South Korea, and the United\\\\n            Kingdom) have leveraged the economic advantages of\\\\n            d-Government.One of the advantages is the lower price of\\\\n            digital transactions\\xe2\\x80\\x9450 times cheaper than face-to-face\\\\n            transactions.While Vietnam has progressed in digital\\\\n            development during the past two years, the gain in the\\\\n            rankings between 2016 and 2018 signifies that countries are\\\\n            gaining in delivery of d-Government services. The DGRA\\\\n            measures the citizen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s demand for d-Government services, and\\\\n            integration and infrastructure policies to delve deeper into\\\\n            the opportunities and challenges the country faces in its\\\\n            digital development journey. The assessment includes a\\\\n            step-by-step analysis of specific components of d-Government\\\\n            and presents an action plan to identify and address areas\\\\n            needing improvement.Open Data Readiness Assessment, the\\\\n            second part of the report focuses on Vietnam\\xe2\\x80\\x99s open data\\\\n            policy. Open data is a policy under which certain\\\\n            government-held data are made publicly available, with very\\\\n            few restrictions on access, in formats that people and\\\\n            software can easily read and use for any purpose. The ODRA\\\\n            is an action-oriented assessment, based on a combination of\\\\n            desk research and stakeholder consultations, designed to\\\\n            assist governments to identify actions needed for an open\\\\n            data regime. The recommendations and actions proposed are\\\\n            based on global best practices and incorporate the\\\\n            experiences and needs of the Government of Vietnam.\"},\"geo_reg_key\":\"517191,517198\",\"repnme\":{\"repnme\":\"Summary Note on Digital Government and Open\\\\n            Data Readiness Assessment\"},\"display_title\":\"Summary Note on Digital\\\\n            Government and Open Data Readiness Assessment\",\"disclosure_date\":\"2019-03-25T00:00:00Z\",\"disclosure_type\":\"NA\",\"pdfurl\":\"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/645761553511903633/pdf/Summary-Note-on-Digital-Government-and-Open-Data-Readiness-Assessment.pdf\",\"txturl\":\"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/645761553511903633/text/Summary-Note-on-Digital-Government-and-Open-Data-Readiness-Assessment.txt\",\"listing_relative_url\":\"/projects/documents/2019/01/30920835/summary-note-digital-government-open-data-readiness-assessment\",\"url_friendly_title\":\"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/645761553511903633/Summary-Note-on-Digital-Government-and-Open-Data-Readiness-Assessment\",\"new_url\":\"2019/01/30920835/summary-note-digital-government-open-data-readiness-assessment-summary-note-digital-government-open-data-readiness-assessment\",\"ext_pub_date\":\"2019-03-25T00:00:00Z\",\"disclstat\":\"Disclosed\",\"topicv3\":\"Digital Government m1325964 678,Education, Skills Development and Labor\\\\n            Market m1326135 1484,Open Data Policy m1326174 679,Cloud Computing m1326181 676,ICT Security m1326856 670\",\"docm_id\":\"090224b086abe55b\",\"chronical_docm_id\":\"090224b086abe55b\",\"publishtoextweb_dt\":\"2019-03-25T00:00:00Z\",\"totvolnb\":\"1\",\"versiontyp\":\"Final\",\"versiontyp_key\":\"1309935\",\"historic_topic\":\"Information and Communication Technologies,Governance\",\"projectid\":\"P164025\",\"guid\":\"645761553511903633\",\"origu\":\"Indicators and Data Services (DECIS)\",\"no_of_pages\":\"16\",\"available_in\":\"English\",\"fullavailablein\":[],\"url\":\"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/645761553511903633/Summary-Note-on-Digital-Government-and-Open-Data-Readiness-Assessment\"},\"D28099138\":{\"id\":\"28099138\",\"geo_region_mdks\":{\"0\":{\"geo_region_mdk\":\"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!Sub-Saharan Africa\"},\"1\":{\"geo_region_mdk\":\"Middle East and North Africa!$!119229\"},\"2\":{\"geo_region_mdk\":\"World!$!517191\"}},\"admreg\":\"Africa,Africa\",\"admreg_key\":\"119222,119222\",\"authors\":{\"0\":{\"author\":\"Klingen,Nicole\"}},\"count\":\"Ethiopia\",\"count_key\":\"82611\",\"docna\":{\"0\":{\"docna\":\"Ethiopia - Supporting Open Data Initiative\\\\n            Project : restructuring\"}},\"docty\":\"Project Paper\",\"docty_key\":\"810308\",\"owner\":\"GOV PSI - AFR 5 (GGO27),GOV PSI - AFR 5\",\"projn\":\"ET-Ethiopia: Supporting Open Data Initiative\\\\n            -- P156400\",\"subsc\":\"Public administration - Information and communications,Other Public Administration,Public Administration - Information and\\\\n            Communications Technologies\",\"trustfund\":\"TF0A1329-Ethiopia: Supporting Open Data Initiative\",\"trustfund_key\":\"1420980\",\"theme\":\"e-Government,Other public sector governance,Public sector governance\",\"prdln\":\"Recipient Executed Activities\",\"prdln_key\":\"904549\",\"seccl\":\"Public\",\"lang\":\"English\",\"lang_key\":\"120701\",\"lndinstr\":{\"0\":{\"lndinstr\":\"Investment Project Financing\"}},\"lndinstr_key\":\"1353855\",\"entityids\":{\"entityid\":\"090224b0851247b8_1_0\"},\"majtheme\":\"Public sector governance\",\"subtopic\":\"Health Care Services Industry,Information Technology,Transport Services,ICT Policy and Strategies,Educational Sciences,ICT Legal and Regulatory Framework\",\"subtopic_key\":\"672747,672817,792547,672821,672941,672819\",\"sectr\":{\"0\":{\"sector\":\"Public Administration\"},\"1\":{\"sector\":\"Information and Communications Technologies\"}},\"sectr_key\":\"369163,369164\",\"repnb\":\"RES29853\",\"docdt\":\"2017-10-23T00:00:00Z\",\"datestored\":\"2017-10-23T00:00:00Z\",\"keywd\":{\"0\":{\"keywd\":\"Open Data;information and communication\\\\n            technology;payments to the consultant;Open Data\\\\n            Initiative;government data;mobile service;financial\\\\n            management procedure;analytical and advisory;suspension of\\\\n            disbursement;finance and economic;\"}},\"volnb\":\"1\",\"geo_regions\":{\"0\":{\"geo_region\":\"Sub-Saharan Africa\"},\"1\":{\"geo_region\":\"Middle East and North Africa\"},\"2\":{\"geo_region\":\"World\"}},\"majdocty\":\"Project Documents,Project Documents\",\"majdocty_key\":\"658102,658102\",\"abstracts\":{\"cdata!\":\"The development objective of this\\\\n            Supporting Open Data Initiative Project is to enhance\\\\n            transparency through the implementation of actions and\\\\n            recommendations emanating from the country and rsquo;s Open\\\\n            Data Readiness Assessment (ODRA) and the action plan.

The guide\\xe2\\x80\\x99s content is based on experience in\\\\n            implementing the initial Open Cities projects in Bangladesh,\\\\n            Nepal, and Sri Lanka as well as on previous mapping project\\\\n            experience. Where relevant, it provides relevant examples\\\\n            from those projects in the text and full case studies at the\\\\n            end of guide. The next chapter, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Project Design and\\\\n            Preparation,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 covers how a project design process begins: by\\\\n            identifying partners, clarifying a project\\xe2\\x80\\x99s objectives and\\\\n            scope, assembling a team of managers and mappers, and\\\\n            assessing the necessary resources for mapping. Chapter\\\\n            three, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Getting Started,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 then describes the steps after the\\\\n            initial planning stage: how to locate an appropriate\\\\n            workspace, assess equipment costs, and prepare staff\\\\n            training.

Some lessons learned included:\\\\n            Given the scope of the project, the design recommended\\\\n            submission of one external audit report on the use of the\\\\n            resources at the end of the project life.

Specifically, it assesses potential opportunities and\\\\n            challenges of improving digital government and open data\\\\n            initiatives in the country. Although DGRA and ODRA are two\\\\n            separate assessments with different dimensions evaluated,\\\\n            they take a similar methodological approach from a broader\\\\n            point of view, starting with the desk research and later\\\\n            expanding to scoping mission. Therefore, both chapters of\\\\n            DGRA and ODRA are similar in format but outlined in\\\\n            respective assessment dimension and individual indicators.\\\\n            Since its onset in the fall of 2017, intensive desk research\\\\n            was conducted, and a field mission was carried out to\\\\n            confirm preliminary findings and uncover additional insight\\\\n            during a specific period in time, which means that during\\\\n            the course of analysis and writing additional developments\\\\n            could have been made. This is similar to the United Nations\\\\n            global e-government development report, which assesses\\\\n            progress during a \\xe2\\x80\\x9csnapshot\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in time.DGRA, the first part of\\\\n            the report, aims to evaluate Vietnam\\xe2\\x80\\x99s current potential for\\\\n            digital government development across seven key dimensions\\\\n            of leadership and governance; user focus; business process\\\\n            change; capabilities; culture and skills; shared\\\\n            infrastructure; data driven; and cybersecurity, privacy and\\\\n            resilience. Meanwhile, ODRA assesses Vietnam\\xe2\\x80\\x99s open data\\\\n            policy through evaluating eight different dimensions of\\\\n            leadership; policy/legal framework; institutional structure;\\\\n            data within government; demand; citizen engagement; funding;\\\\n            and infrastructure.The DGRA chapter focuses on digital\\\\n            government, which is a core part of Digital Economy as\\\\n            public sector delivers information and services more\\\\n            effectively and make them accessible to its citizens.The\\\\n            DGRA also measures the citizen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s demand for digital\\\\n            government services as well as integration and\\\\n            infrastructure policies to delve deeper into the\\\\n            opportunities and challenges the country faces in its\\\\n            digital development journey. The assessment includes a\\\\n            step-by-step analysis of specific components of digital\\\\n            government and presents an action plan to address the\\\\n            challenges identified for improvement.ODRA, the second part\\\\n            of the report, focuses on the country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s open data policy.\\\\n            Open data refers that the data must be both legally and\\\\n            technically open to public, thus placed in the public domain\\\\n            or under liberal terms of use with minimal restrictions, and\\\\n            that the data is published in machine-readable and\\\\n            preferably in non-proprietary electronic formats, which\\\\n            enables everyone to access and use data with freely\\\\n            available software tools.This report, bringing DGRA and ODRA\\\\n            assessments altogether, aims to help raise awareness of\\\\n            digital government and open data, two critical topics as\\\\n            Vietnam prepares its next step for the fourth industrial\\\\n            revolution (Industry 4.0). Further, it hopes to serve as a\\\\n            useful resource for the top government leadership in\\\\n            identifying areas of relative strengths and weaknesses to\\\\n            help improve digital government and open data at the same time.\"},\"geo_reg_key\":\"517198,517191\",\"repnme\":{\"repnme\":\"Digital Government and Open Data Readiness Assessment\"},\"display_title\":\"Digital Government and Open Data\\\\n            Readiness Assessment\",\"disclosure_date\":\"2019-10-01T00:00:00Z\",\"disclosure_type\":\"NA\",\"pdfurl\":\"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/311651553511049630/pdf/Digital-Government-and-Open-Data-Readiness-Assessment.pdf\",\"txturl\":\"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/311651553511049630/text/Digital-Government-and-Open-Data-Readiness-Assessment.txt\",\"listing_relative_url\":\"/research/2019/02/30920848/digital-government-open-data-readiness-assessment\",\"url_friendly_title\":\"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/311651553511049630/Digital-Government-and-Open-Data-Readiness-Assessment\",\"new_url\":\"2019/02/30920848/Digital-Government-and-Open-Data-Readiness-Assessment\",\"ext_pub_date\":\"2019-10-01T00:00:00Z\",\"disclstat\":\"Disclosed\",\"topicv3\":\"Digital Government m1325964 678,e-Government m1326105 2358,Education, Skills Development and Labor\\\\n            Market m1326135 1484,Open Data Policy m1326174 679,ICT Security m1326856 670\",\"docm_id\":\"090224b08716c925\",\"chronical_docm_id\":\"090224b086abe73f\",\"publishtoextweb_dt\":\"2019-10-01T00:00:00Z\",\"totvolnb\":\"1\",\"versiontyp\":\"Revised\",\"versiontyp_key\":\"1309936\",\"historic_topic\":\"Governance,Public Sector Development,Information and Communication Technologies\",\"projectid\":\"P164025\",\"guid\":\"311651553511049630\",\"origu\":\"Indicators and Data Services (DECIS)\",\"no_of_pages\":\"218\",\"author_keys\":{\"0\":{\"author_key\":\"1578377\"},\"1\":{\"author_key\":\"1473774\"},\"2\":{\"author_key\":\"1172793\"},\"3\":{\"author_key\":\"1334095\"},\"4\":{\"author_key\":\"436890\"}},\"available_in\":\"Vietnamese,English\",\"fullavailablein\":[{\"lang\":\"Vietnamese\",\"entityid\":\"248821570454121344\",\"node_id\":\"30920848\"}],\"url\":\"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/311651553511049630/Digital-Government-and-Open-Data-Readiness-Assessment\"},\"D30920835\":{\"id\":\"30920835\",\"geo_region_mdks\":{\"0\":{\"geo_region_mdk\":\"Southeast Asia!$!Southeast Asia\"},\"1\":{\"geo_region_mdk\":\"World!$!517191\"},\"2\":{\"geo_region_mdk\":\"Asia!$!517198\"}},\"admreg\":\"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific\",\"admreg_key\":\"119225,119225\",\"count\":\"Vietnam\",\"count_key\":\"82695\",\"docna\":{\"0\":{\"docna\":\"Summary Note on Digital Government and Open\\\\n            Data Readiness Assessment\"}},\"docty\":\"Report\",\"docty_key\":\"540664\",\"owner\":\"Indicators and Data Services (DECIS)\",\"projn\":\"VN-Open Data Technical Assistance For\\\\n            Digital Vietnam -- P164025\",\"trustfund\":\"TF0A5182-Open Data Technical Assistance\\\\n            for Digital Vietnam,TF0A6482-Vietnam: Digital Government\\\\n            Implementation of Cloud-Based G2C Services\",\"trustfund_key\":\"1575667,1615326\",\"prdln\":\"Advisory Services & Analytics\",\"prdln_key\":\"1416466\",\"seccl\":\"Public\",\"lang\":\"English\",\"lang_key\":\"120701\",\"entityids\":{\"entityid\":\"090224b086abe55b_1_0\"},\"subtopic\":\"ICT Policy and Strategies,ICT Legal and Regulatory Framework,ICT Applications,E-Government,Information Technology\",\"subtopic_key\":\"672821,672819,672822,672705,672817\",\"teratopic\":\"Information and Communication Technologies,Governance\",\"teratopic_key\":\"644292,644283\",\"repnb\":\"135526\",\"docdt\":\"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z\",\"datestored\":\"2019-03-25T00:00:00Z\",\"keywd\":{\"0\":{\"keywd\":\"Open Data;

Industries adopt new technologies that\\\\n            bring market disruptions, and societal and economic\\\\n            advances. While technologies inundate the world with huge\\\\n            amount of data, it seems that the world has envisioned and\\\\n            shared an understanding on future pathways, referred to as\\\\n            the new industrial wave of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFourth Industrial Revolution,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\\\n            (Industry 4.0). Governments must customize their digital\\\\n            strategies to fit their unique environment and needs.report\\\\n            is intended to help the Government of Vietnam assess their\\\\n            digital environments and frame their own strategies. The\\\\n            report contains two themes of Digital Government Readiness\\\\n            Assessment (DGRA) and Open Data Readiness Assessment\\\\n            (ODRA),Digital Government Readiness Assessment, the first\\\\n            part of the report evaluates Vietnam\\xe2\\x80\\x99s current potential for\\\\n            digital government (d-Government) development.The DGRA\\\\n            chapter focuses on d-Government, since the public sector\\\\n            delivers to citizens information and services. According to\\\\n            the biennial United Nations E-Government Development Index\\\\n            (EGDI), governments providing services via digital platforms\\\\n            (such as: Australia, Singapore, South Korea, and the United\\\\n            Kingdom) have leveraged the economic advantages of\\\\n            d-Government.One of the advantages is the lower price of\\\\n            digital transactions\\xe2\\x80\\x9450 times cheaper than face-to-face\\\\n            transactions.While Vietnam has progressed in digital\\\\n            development during the past two years, the gain in the\\\\n            rankings between 2016 and 2018 signifies that countries are\\\\n            gaining in delivery of d-Government services. The DGRA\\\\n            measures the citizen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s demand for d-Government services, and\\\\n            integration and infrastructure policies to delve deeper into\\\\n            the opportunities and challenges the country faces in its\\\\n            digital development journey. The assessment includes a\\\\n            step-by-step analysis of specific components of d-Government\\\\n            and presents an action plan to identify and address areas\\\\n            needing improvement.Open Data Readiness Assessment, the\\\\n            second part of the report focuses on Vietnam\\xe2\\x80\\x99s open data\\\\n            policy. Open data is a policy under which certain\\\\n            government-held data are made publicly available, with very\\\\n            few restrictions on access, in formats that people and\\\\n            software can easily read and use for any purpose. The ODRA\\\\n            is an action-oriented assessment, based on a combination of\\\\n            desk research and stakeholder consultations, designed to\\\\n            assist governments to identify actions needed for an open\\\\n            data regime. The recommendations and actions proposed are\\\\n            based on global best practices and incorporate the\\\\n            experiences and needs of the Government of Vietnam.\"},\"geo_reg_key\":\"517191,517198\",\"repnme\":{\"repnme\":\"Summary Note on Digital Government and Open\\\\n            Data Readiness Assessment\"},\"display_title\":\"Summary Note on Digital\\\\n            Government and Open Data Readiness Assessment\",\"disclosure_date\":\"2019-03-25T00:00:00Z\",\"disclosure_type\":\"NA\",\"pdfurl\":\"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/645761553511903633/pdf/Summary-Note-on-Digital-Government-and-Open-Data-Readiness-Assessment.pdf\",\"txturl\":\"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/645761553511903633/text/Summary-Note-on-Digital-Government-and-Open-Data-Readiness-Assessment.txt\",\"listing_relative_url\":\"/projects/documents/2019/01/30920835/summary-note-digital-government-open-data-readiness-assessment\",\"url_friendly_title\":\"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/645761553511903633/Summary-Note-on-Digital-Government-and-Open-Data-Readiness-Assessment\",\"new_url\":\"2019/01/30920835/summary-note-digital-government-open-data-readiness-assessment-summary-note-digital-government-open-data-readiness-assessment\",\"ext_pub_date\":\"2019-03-25T00:00:00Z\",\"disclstat\":\"Disclosed\",\"topicv3\":\"Digital Government m1325964 678,Education, Skills Development and Labor\\\\n            Market m1326135 1484,Open Data Policy m1326174 679,Cloud Computing m1326181 676,ICT Security m1326856 670\",\"docm_id\":\"090224b086abe55b\",\"chronical_docm_id\":\"090224b086abe55b\",\"publishtoextweb_dt\":\"2019-03-25T00:00:00Z\",\"totvolnb\":\"1\",\"versiontyp\":\"Final\",\"versiontyp_key\":\"1309935\",\"historic_topic\":\"Information and Communication Technologies,Governance\",\"projectid\":\"P164025\",\"guid\":\"645761553511903633\",\"origu\":\"Indicators and Data Services (DECIS)\",\"no_of_pages\":\"16\",\"available_in\":\"English\",\"fullavailablein\":[],\"url\":\"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/645761553511903633/Summary-Note-on-Digital-Government-and-Open-Data-Readiness-Assessment\"},\"D28099138\":{\"id\":\"28099138\",\"geo_region_mdks\":{\"0\":{\"geo_region_mdk\":\"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!Sub-Saharan Africa\"},\"1\":{\"geo_region_mdk\":\"Middle East and North Africa!$!119229\"},\"2\":{\"geo_region_mdk\":\"World!$!517191\"}},\"admreg\":\"Africa,Africa\",\"admreg_key\":\"119222,119222\",\"authors\":{\"0\":{\"author\":\"Klingen,Nicole\"}},\"count\":\"Ethiopia\",\"count_key\":\"82611\",\"docna\":{\"0\":{\"docna\":\"Ethiopia - Supporting Open Data Initiative\\\\n            Project : restructuring\"}},\"docty\":\"Project Paper\",\"docty_key\":\"810308\",\"owner\":\"GOV PSI - AFR 5 (GGO27),GOV PSI - AFR 5\",\"projn\":\"ET-Ethiopia: Supporting Open Data Initiative\\\\n            -- P156400\",\"subsc\":\"Public administration - Information and communications,Other Public Administration,Public Administration - Information and\\\\n            Communications Technologies\",\"trustfund\":\"TF0A1329-Ethiopia: Supporting Open Data Initiative\",\"trustfund_key\":\"1420980\",\"theme\":\"e-Government,Other public sector governance,Public sector governance\",\"prdln\":\"Recipient Executed Activities\",\"prdln_key\":\"904549\",\"seccl\":\"Public\",\"lang\":\"English\",\"lang_key\":\"120701\",\"lndinstr\":{\"0\":{\"lndinstr\":\"Investment Project Financing\"}},\"lndinstr_key\":\"1353855\",\"entityids\":{\"entityid\":\"090224b0851247b8_1_0\"},\"majtheme\":\"Public sector governance\",\"subtopic\":\"Health Care Services Industry,Information Technology,Transport Services,ICT Policy and Strategies,Educational Sciences,ICT Legal and Regulatory Framework\",\"subtopic_key\":\"672747,672817,792547,672821,672941,672819\",\"sectr\":{\"0\":{\"sector\":\"Public Administration\"},\"1\":{\"sector\":\"Information and Communications Technologies\"}},\"sectr_key\":\"369163,369164\",\"repnb\":\"RES29853\",\"docdt\":\"2017-10-23T00:00:00Z\",\"datestored\":\"2017-10-23T00:00:00Z\",\"keywd\":{\"0\":{\"keywd\":\"Open Data;information and communication\\\\n            technology;payments to the consultant;Open Data\\\\n            Initiative;government data;mobile service;financial\\\\n            management procedure;analytical and advisory;suspension of\\\\n            disbursement;finance and economic;\"}},\"volnb\":\"1\",\"geo_regions\":{\"0\":{\"geo_region\":\"Sub-Saharan Africa\"},\"1\":{\"geo_region\":\"Middle East and North Africa\"},\"2\":{\"geo_region\":\"World\"}},\"majdocty\":\"Project Documents,Project Documents\",\"majdocty_key\":\"658102,658102\",\"abstracts\":{\"cdata!\":\"The development objective of this\\\\n            Supporting Open Data Initiative Project is to enhance\\\\n            transparency through the implementation of actions and\\\\n            recommendations emanating from the country and rsquo;s Open\\\\n            Data Readiness Assessment (ODRA) and the action plan.

The guide\\xe2\\x80\\x99s content is based on experience in\\\\n            implementing the initial Open Cities projects in Bangladesh,\\\\n            Nepal, and Sri Lanka as well as on previous mapping project\\\\n            experience. Where relevant, it provides relevant examples\\\\n            from those projects in the text and full case studies at the\\\\n            end of guide. The next chapter, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Project Design and\\\\n            Preparation,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 covers how a project design process begins: by\\\\n            identifying partners, clarifying a project\\xe2\\x80\\x99s objectives and\\\\n            scope, assembling a team of managers and mappers, and\\\\n            assessing the necessary resources for mapping. Chapter\\\\n            three, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Getting Started,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 then describes the steps after the\\\\n            initial planning stage: how to locate an appropriate\\\\n            workspace, assess equipment costs, and prepare staff\\\\n            training. Chapter four, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Implementation and Supervision,\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\\\n            takes a practical look at data collection techniques from\\\\n            both the organizational and technical perspectives. It also\\\\n            addresses common challenges and mechanisms for quality\\\\n            control and reporting. Finally, chapter five examines the\\\\n            lessons learned from previous open cities projects and\\\\n            considers future improvements to the overall project design.\"},\"repnme\":{\"repnme\":\"Open Data for Resilience Initiative :\\\\n            Planning and Open Cities Mapping Project\"},\"display_title\":\"Open Data for Resilience\\\\n            Initiative : Planning and Open Cities Mapping Project\",\"disclosure_date\":\"2020-06-19T00:00:00Z\",\"disclosure_type\":\"NA\",\"pdfurl\":\"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/134531592556070536/pdf/Open-Data-for-Resilience-Initiative-Planning-and-Open-Cities-Mapping-Project.pdf\",\"txturl\":\"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/134531592556070536/text/Open-Data-for-Resilience-Initiative-Planning-and-Open-Cities-Mapping-Project.txt\",\"listing_relative_url\":\"/research/2014/01/32146243/open-data-resilience-initiative-planning-open-cities-mapping-project\",\"url_friendly_title\":\"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/134531592556070536/Open-Data-for-Resilience-Initiative-Planning-and-Open-Cities-Mapping-Project\",\"new_url\":\"2014/01/32146243/\",\"ext_pub_date\":\"2020-06-19T00:00:00Z\",\"disclstat\":\"Disclosed\",\"topicv3\":\"Community Mapping m1325941 2362,Education, Skills Development and Labor\\\\n            Market m1326135 1484,Open Data Policy m1326174 679,Disaster Risk Management m1326682 820,Urban Development m1327371 699\",\"docm_id\":\"090224b087a85807\",\"chronical_docm_id\":\"090224b087a85807\",\"publishtoextweb_dt\":\"2020-06-19T00:00:00Z\",\"totvolnb\":\"1\",\"versiontyp\":\"Final\",\"versiontyp_key\":\"1309935\",\"historic_topic\":\"Social Development,Communities and Human Settlements,Science and Technology Development,Information and Communication Technologies,Conflict and Development,Urban Development\",\"projectid\":\"P153507\",\"guid\":\"134531592556070536\",\"origu\":\"Climate Change-D1-GFDRR-IBRD (GFDRR)\",\"no_of_pages\":\"98\",\"author_keys\":{\"0\":{\"author_key\":\"713267\"},\"1\":{\"author_key\":\"1147703\"},\"2\":{\"author_key\":\"1277181\"},\"3\":{\"author_key\":\"1192621\"},\"4\":{\"author_key\":\"1232331\"}},\"available_in\":\"English\",\"fullavailablein\":[],\"url\":\"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/134531592556070536/Open-Data-for-Resilience-Initiative-Planning-and-Open-Cities-Mapping-Project\"},\"D31007404\":{\"id\":\"31007404\",\"geo_region_mdks\":{\"0\":{\"geo_region_mdk\":\"Middle East and North Africa!$!119229\"},\"1\":{\"geo_region_mdk\":\"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!Sub-Saharan Africa\"},\"2\":{\"geo_region_mdk\":\"World!$!517191\"}},\"admreg\":\"Africa,Africa\",\"admreg_key\":\"119222,119222\",\"authors\":{\"0\":{\"author\":\"Araya,Elsa\"}},\"count\":\"Ethiopia\",\"count_key\":\"82611\",\"docna\":{\"0\":{\"docna\":\"Implementation Completion and Results Report\\\\n            (ICR) Document -  Ethiopia: Supporting Open Data Initiative\\\\n            - P156400\"}},\"docty\":\"Implementation Completion and Results Report\",\"docty_key\":\"540632\",\"owner\":\"EFI-AFR1-GOV-FM & PS-1 (EA1G1)\",\"projn\":\"ET-Ethiopia: Supporting Open Data Initiative\\\\n            -- P156400\",\"subsc\":\"Public Administration - Information and\\\\n            Communications Technologies,Other Public Administration\",\"trustfund\":\"TF0A1329-Ethiopia: Supporting Open Data Initiative\",\"trustfund_key\":\"1420980\",\"theme\":\"Other public sector governance\",\"prdln\":\"Recipient Executed Activities\",\"prdln_key\":\"904549\",\"seccl\":\"Public\",\"lang\":\"English\",\"lang_key\":\"120701\",\"lndinstr\":{\"0\":{\"lndinstr\":\"Investment Project Financing\"}},\"lndinstr_key\":\"1353855\",\"entityids\":{\"entityid\":\"090224b086bf1a8f_1_0\"},\"majtheme\":\"Public sector governance\",\"subtopic\":\"Health Care Services Industry,Information Technology,Transport Services,ICT Policy and Strategies,Educational Sciences,ICT Legal and Regulatory Framework\",\"subtopic_key\":\"672747,672817,792547,672821,672941,672819\",\"teratopic\":\"Industry,Transport,Education,Information and Communication Technologies\",\"teratopic_key\":\"644286,644303,644301,644292\",\"sectr\":{\"0\":{\"sector\":\"Public Administration\"},\"1\":{\"sector\":\"Information and Communications Technologies\"}},\"sectr_key\":\"369163,369164\",\"repnb\":\"ICR00004790\",\"docdt\":\"2019-04-24T00:00:00Z\",\"datestored\":\"2019-04-24T00:00:00Z\",\"keywd\":{\"0\":{\"keywd\":\"Open Data;

Traditional approaches to collecting datasets\\\\n            necessary for this informed decision making typically take\\\\n            decades to collect, often rely on top-down approaches, and\\\\n            rarely enable communities to be part of the data gathering\\\\n            and its ultimate use.GFDRR has been implementing its Open\\\\n            Data for Resilience Initiative (OpenDRI) since 2010 in more\\\\n            than 30 highly vulnerable countries. Engaging communities to\\\\n            map their own communities has proven to be a powerful and\\\\n            sustainable approach to building resilience, from Village\\\\n            Elders mapping community borders in Jakarta for the first\\\\n            time, to student volunteers mapping Kathmandu before and\\\\n            after the 2015 earthquake, to communities in flood hit\\\\n            Malawi mapping their own villages (village location and\\\\n            name, community facilities, roads etc.).

Open Data is\\\\n            data, which anyone is free to use, re-use or redistribute\\\\n            it, subject at most to measures that preserve provenance and\\\\n            openness. The World Bank identifies two dimensions of data\\\\n            openness: 1. The data must be legally open, which means they\\\\n            must be placed in the public domain or under liberal terms\\\\n            of use with minimal restrictions. 2. The data must be\\\\n            technically open, which means they must be published in\\\\n            electronic formats that are machine readable and preferably\\\\n            non-proprietary, so that anyone can access and use the data\\\\n            using common, freely available software tools. Data must\\\\n            also be publicly available and accessible on a public\\\\n            server, without password or firewall restrictions. The World\\\\n            Bank has led the technical support to Tanzania\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Open Data\\\\n            Initiative through UK Aid funded SOGDAT Programme from 2014.\\\\n            This followed the Government of Tanzania (GoT) joining the\\\\n            Open Government Partnership (OGP) in 2012 and committing to:\\\\n            (i) promote public integrity and transparency, enhance\\\\n            proper management of public resources and fight corruption;\\\\n            and (ii) strengthen mechanisms for citizens\\xe2\\x80\\x99 engagement and\\\\n            participation in improving service delivery in their own\\\\n            areas.Following the development of the Tanzania OGP National\\\\n            Action Plan 2012-2013 the Bank and Government of Tanzania\\\\n            conducted jointly an Open Data Readiness Assessment (ODRA)\\\\n            in 2013, which led to articulating main drivers for Tanzania\\\\n            Open Data Initiative (TODI): transparency, efficiency,\\\\n            service delivery and innovation. A revised plan for OGP\\\\n            implementation between 2014 and 2016 provided for a longer\\\\n            time frame to achieve commitments and maintained an explicit\\\\n            category for establishing an open data programme.Other\\\\n            benefits, such as government cost savings or increased\\\\n            investment in data quality resulting from the need to\\\\n            publish raw data, are more easily measured in the\\\\n            short-run.The Open Data Barometer places Tanzania in the\\\\n            \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccapacity constrained\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cluster of countries whose open data\\\\n            initiatives are challenged by limits in government, civil\\\\n            society or private sector capacity, internet penetration,\\\\n            and data collection and management. The Bank\\xe2\\x80\\x99s support\\\\n            through SOGDAT has focussed on three pillars: 1) The policy\\\\n            and legal framework; 2) The supply of datasets; and 3) The\\\\n            demand for open data.This report maintains the original Data\\\\n            supply and data demand structure of previous years, but in\\\\n            order to fully illustrate the steps involved, the Data\\\\n            Supply model is expanded into its component phases of:\\\\n            Collection, Sharing, and Analysis. The Data Demand model\\\\n            remains with its focus on data users but will also\\\\n            distinguish between service providers, infomediaries and\\\\n            basic skills capacity building.\"},\"repnme\":{\"repnme\":\"Support to open government, data, and\\\\n            accountability in Tanzania : progress report\"},\"display_title\":\"Support to open government, data,\\\\n            and accountability in Tanzania : progress report\",\"disclosure_date\":\"2018-06-22T00:00:00Z\",\"disclosure_type\":\"NA\",\"pdfurl\":\"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/933101529919350715/pdf/SOGDAT-Year-3-Report.pdf\",\"txturl\":\"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/933101529919350715/text/SOGDAT-Year-3-Report.txt\",\"listing_relative_url\":\"/research/2018/06/30140233/support-open-government-data-accountability-tanzania-progress-report\",\"url_friendly_title\":\"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/933101529919350715/Support-to-open-government-data-and-accountability-in-Tanzania-progress-report\",\"new_url\":\"2018/06/30140233/support-open-government-data-accountability-tanzania-progress-report\",\"ext_pub_date\":\"2018-06-22T00:00:00Z\",\"disclstat\":\"Disclosed\",\"topicv3\":\"Open Data Policy m1326174 679,Water m1326522 137,Education m1327048 470,Health m1504661 3480,Digitization m1505678 3078\",\"docm_id\":\"090224b085c23606\",\"chronical_docm_id\":\"090224b085c23606\",\"publishtoextweb_dt\":\"2018-06-22T00:00:00Z\",\"totvolnb\":\"1\",\"versiontyp\":\"Final\",\"versiontyp_key\":\"1309935\",\"historic_topic\":\"Industry,Water Resources,Education,Information and Communication Technologies\",\"projectid\":\"P150543\",\"guid\":\"933101529919350715\",\"origu\":\"Urban, DRM AFR 1 (GSU13)\",\"no_of_pages\":\"52\",\"available_in\":\"English\",\"fullavailablein\":[],\"url\":\"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/933101529919350715/Support-to-open-government-data-and-accountability-in-Tanzania-progress-report\"},\"D32883855\":{\"id\":\"32883855\",\"admreg\":\"The World Region,The World Region,Other,Other\",\"admreg_key\":\"622170,622170,912972,912972\",\"count\":\"World\",\"count_key\":\"517191\",\"docna\":{\"0\":{\"docna\":\"Open Contracting : Data Standard\"}},\"docty\":\"Brief\",\"docty_key\":\"965331\",\"owner\":\"N/A\",\"projn\":\"1W-Open Contracts: Promoting Greater\\\\n            Transparency And Monitoring O -- P128753\",\"subsc\":\"Health,Other Agriculture, Fishing and Forestry,Mining,Other Public Administration,Public Administration - Energy and Extractives\",\"theme\":\"Other accountability/anti-corruption,Public expenditure, financial management and procurement,Climate change\",\"prdln\":\"Advisory Services & Analytics\",\"prdln_key\":\"1416466\",\"seccl\":\"Public\",\"lang\":\"English\",\"lang_key\":\"120701\",\"entityids\":{\"entityid\":\"090224b088366274_1_0\"},\"majtheme\":\"Public sector governance,Environment and natural resource management\",\"subtopic\":\"ICT Policy and Strategies,ICT Legal and Regulatory Framework,Energy and Environment,Energy Demand,Energy and Mining,Information Technology\",\"subtopic_key\":\"672821,672819,787150,787146,787154,672817\",\"teratopic\":\"Energy,Information and Communication Technologies\",\"teratopic_key\":\"644304,644292\",\"sectr\":{\"0\":{\"sector\":\"Health\"},\"1\":{\"sector\":\"Public Administration\"},\"2\":{\"sector\":\"Energy and Extractives\"},\"3\":{\"sector\":\"Agriculture, Fishing and Forestry\"}},\"sectr_key\":\"369168,369163,647629,369180\",\"repnb\":\"157242\",\"docdt\":\"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z\",\"datestored\":\"2021-03-05T00:00:00Z\",\"volnb\":\"1\",\"majdocty\":\"Publications & Research,Publications & Research\",\"majdocty_key\":\"658101,658101\",\"abstracts\":{\"cdata!\":\"This brief focuses on the Open\\\\n            Contracting Data Standard (OCDS) designed to cover each\\\\n            complete contracting process from planning and budgeting, to\\\\n            tender (or negotiation), award, contract, implementation and\\\\n            completion.

The activity is GBP3\\\\n            million and aligns with the Government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Open Government\\\\n            Partnership (OGP) initiative as well as Big Results Now\\\\n            programme in Water and Education sectors. In 2011 Tanzania\\\\n            signed up to the OGP \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a unique multilateral initiative\\\\n            where governments have pledged to become more open,\\\\n            accountable, and responsive to citizens. Under the program,\\\\n            Tanzania has committed to: (i) promote public integrity and\\\\n            transparency, enhance proper management of public resources\\\\n            and fight corruption; and (ii) strengthen mechanisms for\\\\n            citizens engagement and participation in improving service\\\\n            delivery in their own areas. Tanzania\\'s first two year\\\\n            OGP action plan was implemented between 2011 and 2013 with\\\\n            limited success. A revised second plan for OGP\\\\n            implementation between 2014 and 2016 has now been adopted.\\\\n            The Government of Tanzania also adopted in 2013 a new\\\\n            results delivery model, known in Tanzania as Big Results\\\\n            Now! (BRN). The BRN places a strong focus on results, with\\\\n            accountability and performance management at the core of\\\\n            implementation and is focused on seven priority sectors\\\\n            including Education and Rural Water. The Government of\\\\n            Tanzania (GoT) has made progress in increasing accessibility\\\\n            and transparency of information to monitor progress in\\\\n            service delivery and in May 2013 it conducted an Open Data\\\\n            Readiness Assessment (ODRA) with the Bank\\xe2\\x80\\x99s support.

As the gatekeepers of\\\\n            official statistics, National Statistics Offices (NSOs)\\\\n            produce many datasets that could typically comprise the\\\\n            foundation of an Open Data program.

Specifically, it assesses potential opportunities and\\n            challenges of improving digital government and open data\\n            initiatives in the country. Although DGRA and ODRA are two\\n            separate assessments with different dimensions evaluated,\\n            they take a similar methodological approach from a broader\\n            point of view, starting with the desk research and later\\n            expanding to scoping mission. Therefore, both chapters of\\n            DGRA and ODRA are similar in format but outlined in\\n            respective assessment dimension and individual indicators.\\n            Since its onset in the fall of 2017, intensive desk research\\n            was conducted, and a field mission was carried out to\\n            confirm preliminary findings and uncover additional insight\\n            during a specific period in time, which means that during\\n            the course of analysis and writing additional developments\\n            could have been made. This is similar to the United Nations\\n            global e-government development report, which assesses\\n            progress during a “snapshot” in time.DGRA, the first part of\\n            the report, aims to evaluate Vietnam’s current potential for\\n            digital government development across seven key dimensions\\n            of leadership and governance; user focus; business process\\n            change; capabilities; culture and skills; shared\\n            infrastructure; data driven; and cybersecurity, privacy and\\n            resilience. Meanwhile, ODRA assesses Vietnam’s open data\\n            policy through evaluating eight different dimensions of\\n            leadership; policy/legal framework; institutional structure;\\n            data within government; demand; citizen engagement; funding;\\n            and infrastructure.The DGRA chapter focuses on digital\\n            government, which is a core part of Digital Economy as\\n            public sector delivers information and services more\\n            effectively and make them accessible to its citizens.The\\n            DGRA also measures the citizen’s demand for digital\\n            government services as well as integration and\\n            infrastructure policies to delve deeper into the\\n            opportunities and challenges the country faces in its\\n            digital development journey. The assessment includes a\\n            step-by-step analysis of specific components of digital\\n            government and presents an action plan to address the\\n            challenges identified for improvement.ODRA, the second part\\n            of the report, focuses on the country’s open data policy.\\n            Open data refers that the data must be both legally and\\n            technically open to public, thus placed in the public domain\\n            or under liberal terms of use with minimal restrictions, and\\n            that the data is published in machine-readable and\\n            preferably in non-proprietary electronic formats, which\\n            enables everyone to access and use data with freely\\n            available software tools.This report, bringing DGRA and ODRA\\n            assessments altogether, aims to help raise awareness of\\n            digital government and open data, two critical topics as\\n            Vietnam prepares its next step for the fourth industrial\\n            revolution (Industry 4.0). Further, it hopes to serve as a\\n            useful resource for the top government leadership in\\n            identifying areas of relative strengths and weaknesses to\\n            help improve digital government and open data at the same time.'},\n",

Industries adopt new technologies that\\n            bring market disruptions, and societal and economic\\n            advances. While technologies inundate the world with huge\\n            amount of data, it seems that the world has envisioned and\\n            shared an understanding on future pathways, referred to as\\n            the new industrial wave of “Fourth Industrial Revolution,”\\n            (Industry 4.0). Governments must customize their digital\\n            strategies to fit their unique environment and needs.report\\n            is intended to help the Government of Vietnam assess their\\n            digital environments and frame their own strategies. The\\n            report contains two themes of Digital Government Readiness\\n            Assessment (DGRA) and Open Data Readiness Assessment\\n            (ODRA),Digital Government Readiness Assessment, the first\\n            part of the report evaluates Vietnam’s current potential for\\n            digital government (d-Government) development.The DGRA\\n            chapter focuses on d-Government, since the public sector\\n            delivers to citizens information and services. According to\\n            the biennial United Nations E-Government Development Index\\n            (EGDI), governments providing services via digital platforms\\n            (such as: Australia, Singapore, South Korea, and the United\\n            Kingdom) have leveraged the economic advantages of\\n            d-Government.One of the advantages is the lower price of\\n            digital transactions—50 times cheaper than face-to-face\\n            transactions.While Vietnam has progressed in digital\\n            development during the past two years, the gain in the\\n            rankings between 2016 and 2018 signifies that countries are\\n            gaining in delivery of d-Government services. The DGRA\\n            measures the citizen’s demand for d-Government services, and\\n            integration and infrastructure policies to delve deeper into\\n            the opportunities and challenges the country faces in its\\n            digital development journey. The assessment includes a\\n            step-by-step analysis of specific components of d-Government\\n            and presents an action plan to identify and address areas\\n            needing improvement.Open Data Readiness Assessment, the\\n            second part of the report focuses on Vietnam’s open data\\n            policy. Open data is a policy under which certain\\n            government-held data are made publicly available, with very\\n            few restrictions on access, in formats that people and\\n            software can easily read and use for any purpose. The ODRA\\n            is an action-oriented assessment, based on a combination of\\n            desk research and stakeholder consultations, designed to\\n            assist governments to identify actions needed for an open\\n            data regime. The recommendations and actions proposed are\\n            based on global best practices and incorporate the\\n            experiences and needs of the Government of Vietnam.'},\n",

The guide’s content is based on experience in\\n            implementing the initial Open Cities projects in Bangladesh,\\n            Nepal, and Sri Lanka as well as on previous mapping project\\n            experience. Where relevant, it provides relevant examples\\n            from those projects in the text and full case studies at the\\n            end of guide. The next chapter, ‘Project Design and\\n            Preparation,’ covers how a project design process begins: by\\n            identifying partners, clarifying a project’s objectives and\\n            scope, assembling a team of managers and mappers, and\\n            assessing the necessary resources for mapping. Chapter\\n            three, ‘Getting Started,’ then describes the steps after the\\n            initial planning stage: how to locate an appropriate\\n            workspace, assess equipment costs, and prepare staff\\n            training. Chapter four, ‘Implementation and Supervision,’\\n            takes a practical look at data collection techniques from\\n            both the organizational and technical perspectives. It also\\n            addresses common challenges and mechanisms for quality\\n            control and reporting. Finally, chapter five examines the\\n            lessons learned from previous open cities projects and\\n            considers future improvements to the overall project design.'},\n",

Traditional approaches to collecting datasets\\n            necessary for this informed decision making typically take\\n            decades to collect, often rely on top-down approaches, and\\n            rarely enable communities to be part of the data gathering\\n            and its ultimate use.GFDRR has been implementing its Open\\n            Data for Resilience Initiative (OpenDRI) since 2010 in more\\n            than 30 highly vulnerable countries. Engaging communities to\\n            map their own communities has proven to be a powerful and\\n            sustainable approach to building resilience, from Village\\n            Elders mapping community borders in Jakarta for the first\\n            time, to student volunteers mapping Kathmandu before and\\n            after the 2015 earthquake, to communities in flood hit\\n            Malawi mapping their own villages (village location and\\n            name, community facilities, roads etc.). The process also\\n            connects local mappers with the international community of\\n            open mappers, provides fundamental on-the-job training and\\n            ultimately provides a trained network of volunteers who can\\n            respond to map damaged areas when disasters strike and map\\n            exposure and vulnerabilities to anticipate future disaster\\n            impacts. The Government of Belgium committed to building\\n            resilience through innovation in Sub-Saharan Africa through\\n            the allocation of EUR 600,000 in funding to the Global\\n            Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) in\\n            December 2016. Uganda, Niger, Tanzania, and Mozambique were\\n            selected to pilot innovations in disaster risk management.\\n            The innovations included novel approaches to risk assessment\\n            and the collection and visualization of hazard data in\\n            real-time from social media.'},\n",

Open Data is\\n            data, which anyone is free to use, re-use or redistribute\\n            it, subject at most to measures that preserve provenance and\\n            openness. The World Bank identifies two dimensions of data\\n            openness: 1. The data must be legally open, which means they\\n            must be placed in the public domain or under liberal terms\\n            of use with minimal restrictions. 2. The data must be\\n            technically open, which means they must be published in\\n            electronic formats that are machine readable and preferably\\n            non-proprietary, so that anyone can access and use the data\\n            using common, freely available software tools. Data must\\n            also be publicly available and accessible on a public\\n            server, without password or firewall restrictions. The World\\n            Bank has led the technical support to Tanzania’s Open Data\\n            Initiative through UK Aid funded SOGDAT Programme from 2014.\\n            This followed the Government of Tanzania (GoT) joining the\\n            Open Government Partnership (OGP) in 2012 and committing to:\\n            (i) promote public integrity and transparency, enhance\\n            proper management of public resources and fight corruption;\\n            and (ii) strengthen mechanisms for citizens’ engagement and\\n            participation in improving service delivery in their own\\n            areas.Following the development of the Tanzania OGP National\\n            Action Plan 2012-2013 the Bank and Government of Tanzania\\n            conducted jointly an Open Data Readiness Assessment (ODRA)\\n            in 2013, which led to articulating main drivers for Tanzania\\n            Open Data Initiative (TODI): transparency, efficiency,\\n            service delivery and innovation. A revised plan for OGP\\n            implementation between 2014 and 2016 provided for a longer\\n            time frame to achieve commitments and maintained an explicit\\n            category for establishing an open data programme.Other\\n            benefits, such as government cost savings or increased\\n            investment in data quality resulting from the need to\\n            publish raw data, are more easily measured in the\\n            short-run.The Open Data Barometer places Tanzania in the\\n            “capacity constrained” cluster of countries whose open data\\n            initiatives are challenged by limits in government, civil\\n            society or private sector capacity, internet penetration,\\n            and data collection and management. The Bank’s support\\n            through SOGDAT has focussed on three pillars: 1) The policy\\n            and legal framework; 2) The supply of datasets; and 3) The\\n            demand for open data.This report maintains the original Data\\n            supply and data demand structure of previous years, but in\\n            order to fully illustrate the steps involved, the Data\\n            Supply model is expanded into its component phases of:\\n            Collection, Sharing, and Analysis. The Data Demand model\\n            remains with its focus on data users but will also\\n            distinguish between service providers, infomediaries and\\n            basic skills capacity building.'},\n",

The activity is GBP3\\n            million and aligns with the Government’s Open Government\\n            Partnership (OGP) initiative as well as Big Results Now\\n            programme in Water and Education sectors. In 2011 Tanzania\\n            signed up to the OGP – a unique multilateral initiative\\n            where governments have pledged to become more open,\\n            accountable, and responsive to citizens. Under the program,\\n            Tanzania has committed to: (i) promote public integrity and\\n            transparency, enhance proper management of public resources\\n            and fight corruption; and (ii) strengthen mechanisms for\\n            citizens engagement and participation in improving service\\n            delivery in their own areas. Tanzania's first two year\\n            OGP action plan was implemented between 2011 and 2013 with\\n            limited success. A revised second plan for OGP\\n            implementation between 2014 and 2016 has now been adopted.\\n            The Government of Tanzania also adopted in 2013 a new\\n            results delivery model, known in Tanzania as Big Results\\n            Now! (BRN). The BRN places a strong focus on results, with\\n            accountability and performance management at the core of\\n            implementation and is focused on seven priority sectors\\n            including Education and Rural Water. The Government of\\n            Tanzania (GoT) has made progress in increasing accessibility\\n            and transparency of information to monitor progress in\\n            service delivery and in May 2013 it conducted an Open Data\\n            Readiness Assessment (ODRA) with the Bank’s support. The\\n            report finds that the country still lags behind its East\\n            Africa neighbors in open, online data provision and outlines\\n            key opportunities for open data to support the goals\\n            embodied in the BRN initiatives .As part of its OGP\\n            commitments Tanzania aims to publish and share, at local and\\n            national levels, key information about the health, education\\n            and water sectors and in June 2013 the Chief Secretary\\n            declared the country would embark on an open data initiative\\n            beginning in these three sectors.\"},\n",

As the gatekeepers of\\n            official statistics, National Statistics Offices (NSOs)\\n            produce many datasets that could typically comprise the\\n            foundation of an Open Data program. They may also have\\n            relationships with other data producing agencies in the\\n            national statistical system and have expertise in dealing\\n            with the many technical and data quality issues attendant in\\n            publishing data. In short, they are extremely well placed to\\n            make a valuable contribution to Open Data initiatives.\\n            Despite these advantages, NSOs do not always feature\\n            prominently in government-sponsored Open Data programs and\\n            they may be missing an important opportunity to expand the\\n            use and re-use of the data they produce.

The report contains two themes of Digital Government Readiness Assessment (DGRA) and Open Data Readiness Assessment (ODRA),Digital Government Readiness Assessment, the first part of the report evaluates Vietnam’s current potential for digital government (d-Government) development.The DGRA chapter focuses on d-Government, since the public sector delivers to citizens information and services. According to the biennial United Nations E-Government Development Index (EGDI), governments providing services via digital platforms (such as: Australia, Singapore, South Korea, and the United Kingdom) have leveraged the economic advantages of d-Government.One of the advantages is the lower price of digital transactions—50 times cheaper than face-to-face transactions.While Vietnam has progressed in digital development during the past two years, the gain in the rankings between 2016 and 2018 signifies that countries are gaining in delivery of d-Government services. The DGRA measures the citizen’s demand for d-Government services, and integration and infrastructure policies to delve deeper into the opportunities and challenges the country faces in its digital development journey. The assessment includes a step-by-step analysis of specific components of d-Government and presents an action plan to identify and address areas needing improvement.Open Data Readiness Assessment, the second part of the report focuses on Vietnam’s open data policy. Open data is a policy under which certain government-held data are made publicly available, with very few restrictions on access, in formats that people and software can easily read and use for any purpose. The ODRA is an action-oriented assessment, based on a combination of desk research and stakeholder consultations, designed to assist governments to identify actions needed for an open data regime.

For example: How much rain has fallen Is my children’s school safe from earthquakes and flood Which roads are underwater and inaccessible in a flood How many communities will be affected by drought or flood during El Niño Without this information, it is impossible to make informed decisions. Traditional approaches to collecting datasets necessary for this informed decision making typically take decades to collect, often rely on top-down approaches, and rarely enable communities to be part of the data gathering and its ultimate use.GFDRR has been implementing its Open Data for Resilience Initiative (OpenDRI) since 2010 in more than 30 highly vulnerable countries. Engaging communities to map their own communities has proven to be a powerful and sustainable approach to building resilience, from Village Elders mapping community borders in Jakarta for the first time, to student volunteers mapping Kathmandu before and after the 2015 earthquake, to communities in flood hit Malawi mapping their own villages (village location and name, community facilities, roads etc.). The process also connects local mappers with the international community of open mappers, provides fundamental on-the-job training and ultimately provides a trained network of volunteers who can respond to map damaged areas when disasters strike and map exposure and vulnerabilities to anticipate future disaster impacts. The Government of Belgium committed to building resilience through innovation in Sub-Saharan Africa through the allocation of EUR 600,000 in funding to the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) in December 2016. Uganda, Niger, Tanzania, and Mozambique were selected to pilot innovations in disaster risk management.

This movement has gained much momentum in this decade; particularly as governments around the world have introduced open data programs. Existing technology allows for the publication of datasets at little or no additional cost to the government and in a manner, which ensures that the use by one person does not affect another’s use. That is, users can access and download datasets in a format that allows them to easily use it for research, analysis, citizen services, disaster management, forecasting, and entrepreneurship; among others. The Open Data Policy of Saint Lucia details one consistent approach to the sharing of data held by all agencies of government; this includes the administrative framework and procedural guidelines.

This document represents a third year progress report on World Bank executed activities under SOGDAT. Open Data is data, which anyone is free to use, re-use or redistribute it, subject at most to measures that preserve provenance and openness. The World Bank identifies two dimensions of data openness: 1. The data must be legally open, which means they must be placed in the public domain or under liberal terms of use with minimal restrictions. 2. The data must be technically open, which means they must be published in electronic formats that are machine readable and preferably non-proprietary, so that anyone can access and use the data using common, freely available software tools. Data must also be publicly available and accessible on a public server, without password or firewall restrictions. The World Bank has led the technical support to Tanzania’s Open Data Initiative through UK Aid funded SOGDAT Programme from 2014. This followed the Government of Tanzania (GoT) joining the Open Government Partnership (OGP) in 2012 and committing to: (i) promote public integrity and transparency, enhance proper management of public resources and fight corruption; and (ii) strengthen mechanisms for citizens’ engagement and participation in improving service delivery in their own areas.Following the development of the Tanzania OGP National Action Plan 2012-2013 the Bank and Government of Tanzania conducted jointly an Open Data Readiness Assessment (ODRA) in 2013, which led to articulating main drivers for Tanzania Open Data Initiative (TODI): transparency, efficiency, service delivery and innovation. A revised plan for OGP implementation between 2014 and 2016 provided for a longer time frame to achieve commitments and maintained an explicit category for establishing an open data programme.Other benefits, such as government cost savings or increased investment in data quality resulting from the need to publish raw data, are more easily measured in the short-run.The Open Data Barometer places Tanzania in the “capacity constrained” cluster of countries whose open data initiatives are challenged by limits in government, civil society or private sector capacity, internet penetration, and data collection and management. The Bank’s support through SOGDAT has focussed on three pillars: 1) The policy and legal framework; 2) The supply of datasets; and 3) The demand for open data.This report maintains the original Data supply and data demand structure of previous years, but in order to fully illustrate the steps involved, the Data Supply model is expanded into its component phases of: Collection, Sharing, and Analysis.

In 2011 Tanzania signed up to the OGP – a unique multilateral initiative where governments have pledged to become more open, accountable, and responsive to citizens. Under the program, Tanzania has committed to: (i) promote public integrity and transparency, enhance proper management of public resources and fight corruption; and (ii) strengthen mechanisms for citizens engagement and participation in improving service delivery in their own areas. Tanzania's first two year OGP action plan was implemented between 2011 and 2013 with limited success. A revised second plan for OGP implementation between 2014 and 2016 has now been adopted. The Government of Tanzania also adopted in 2013 a new results delivery model, known in Tanzania as Big Results Now! (BRN). The BRN places a strong focus on results, with accountability and performance management at the core of implementation and is focused on seven priority sectors including Education and Rural Water. The Government of Tanzania (GoT) has made progress in increasing accessibility and transparency of information to monitor progress in service delivery and in May 2013 it conducted an Open Data Readiness Assessment (ODRA) with the Bank’s support. The report finds that the country still lags behind its East Africa neighbors in open, online data provision and outlines key opportunities for open data to support the goals embodied in the BRN initiatives .As part of its OGP commitments Tanzania aims to publish and share, at local and national levels, key information about the health, education and water sectors and in June 2013 the Chief Secretary declared the country would embark on an open data initiative beginning in these three sectors.\", 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Industry,Water Resources,Education,Information and Communication Technologies'}\n",

Specifically, it assesses potential opportunities and challenges of improving digital government and open data initiatives in the country. Although DGRA and ODRA are two separate assessments with different dimensions evaluated, they take a similar methodological approach from a broader point of view, starting with the desk research and later expanding to scoping mission. Therefore, both chapters of DGRA and ODRA are similar in format but outlined in respective assessment dimension and individual indicators. Since its onset in the fall of 2017, intensive desk research was conducted, and a field mission was carried out to confirm preliminary findings and uncover additional insight during a specific period in time, which means that during the course of analysis and writing additional developments could have been made. This is similar to the United Nations global e-government development report, which assesses progress during a “snapshot” in time.DGRA, the first part of the report, aims to evaluate Vietnam’s current potential for digital government development across seven key dimensions of leadership and governance; user focus; business process change; capabilities; culture and skills; shared infrastructure; data driven; and cybersecurity, privacy and resilience. Meanwhile, ODRA assesses Vietnam’s open data policy through evaluating eight different dimensions of leadership; policy/legal framework; institutional structure; data within government; demand; citizen engagement; funding; and infrastructure.The DGRA chapter focuses on digital government, which is a core part of Digital Economy as public sector delivers information and services more effectively and make them accessible to its citizens.The DGRA also measures the citizen’s demand for digital government services as well as integration and infrastructure policies to delve deeper into the opportunities and challenges the country faces in its digital development journey. The assessment includes a step-by-step analysis of specific components of digital government and presents an action plan to address the challenges identified for improvement.ODRA, the second part of the report, focuses on the country’s open data policy.

National Statistics Offices (NSOs) have the potential to play a pivotal role in the implementation of open data initiatives. As producers and curators of data, the objective of making high quality data more accessible and usable is consistent with their guiding principles. NSOs indicate, in research conducted in support of this report, that one of the difficulties they encounter is that the technology they use to publish - or electronically distribute - data for public use is not compatible with open formats. They also indicate that common software packages used for open data portals do not accommodate the data formats and metadata they produce. Two key concerns related to data dissemination products are addresses: (1) Can such products designed primarily for NSOs satisfy requirements for an open data initiative; and (2) Can such products designed primarily for open data satisfy the requirements of NSOs Furthermore, data reuse, both by data experts and the public at large, is key to creating new opportunities and benefits from government data. The following recommendations are made to improve the overall utility of data publication platforms to NSOs and the open data community: improve technical documentation; ensure public Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and endpoints are interoperable; presentation of metadata and Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) must conform to W3C standards; natural language search and metadata faceting should be standard; structural metadata and hypercube support are core NSO requirements; dashboards and visualisations are necessary for user engagement; and develop data engagement tools for improving data-quality and reuse.', 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'N/A'}\n",

Most discussants agree that for true transparency, it is important not only that governments publish budget data on websites, but that the data they disclose are meaningful and provide a full picture of their financial activities to the public. Most governments have made substantial investments in capacity building and technology for the development of Financial Management Information Systems (FMIS). This study is the first attempt to explore the effects of FMIS on publishing open budget data, identify potential improvements in budget transparency, and provide some guidance on the effective use of FMIS platforms to publish open budget data. Overall, there are only 48 countries (24 percent) where civil society and citizens have the opportunity to benefit from Public Finance (PF) information published on the web to monitor the budget and hold their governments accountable. In many countries, external audit organizations do not appear to be using the FMIS platforms effectively for monitoring the government's financial activities or auditing the budget results. Governments in high-and middle-income economies publish budget data dynamically in various formats, mainly from centralized systems, while many lower-income economies tend to publish static budget data, mostly through documents posted on PF websites. The study shows that only a small group of countries provide good access to reliable open budget data from underlying FMIS solutions. Many governments publish substantial information on their PF websites, but the contents are (not always) meaningful to provide adequate answers to the question, 'Where does the money go' Therefore, the main conclusion of this study is that when it comes to government PF websites, what you see is (not always) what you get. Many governments need to make additional efforts that will build confidence in the budget data they disclose. As citizens and civil society increasingly demand access to open data about all financial activities, governments around the world are trying to respond to this democratic pressure. The outputs of this study are expected to provide a comprehensive view of the status of government practices for publishing budget data around the world, and to promote debates around the improvement of PF web publishing platforms to support transparency, accountability, and participation by disclosing reliable information about all financial activities.\", 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Information and Communication Technologies,Social Development,Governance,Public Sector Development'}\n",

Although some of the benefits of open data initiatives have been assessed in the past, particularly their economic and financial returns, it is often more difficult to evaluate their social and political impacts. In the public sector, a murky theory of change has emerged that links the use of open government data with greater government accountability as well as improved service delivery in key sectors, including health and education, among others. In the absence of cross-country empirical research on this topic, this paper asks the following: Based on the evidence available, to what extent and for what reasons is the use of open government data associated with higher levels of accountability and improved service delivery in developing countries To answer this question, the paper constructs a unique data set that operationalizes open government data, government accountability, service delivery, as well as other intervening and control variables. Relying on data from 25 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, the paper finds a number of significant associations between open government data, accountability, and service delivery. However, the findings suggest differentiated effects of open government data across the health and education sectors, as well as with respect to service provision and service delivery outcomes. Although this early research has limitations and does not attempt to establish a purely causal relationship between the variables, it provides initial empirical support for claims about the efficacy of open government data for improving accountability and service delivery.', 'last_modified_date': '2019-12-16T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Information and Communication Technologies,Industry,Education,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Governance,Public Sector Development'}\n",

The project was a part of the Catching-up Regions Initiative (CuRI) initiated by the European Commission (EC) and was implemented from May 2018 to May 2019. The project included three main activities: (i) the setup and capacity building of the Geographic Information System (GIS) unit placed under the new Department of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT); (ii) the deployment of a geoportal as a part of the technical foundation of the spatial data infrastructure (SDI) and related data integration activity; (iii) engagement with data producers and users in order to foster data collection and data demand. Key deliverables and achievements of the project include: In one year, the situation at the PSK evolved from no GIS unit to a team of qualified people under the responsibility of a new Department of Information and Communication Technologies. The GIS unit includes one director, one system administrator, two GIS consultants, one senior GIS officer, three junior GIS officers, and one data officer.Another important outcome of the project was the decision by the PSK to switch to open source software (OSS). The use of OSS may prevent any vendor lock-in situation in the future. It also helps reduce spending on IT, ensure interoperability, facilitate sharing of infrastructures, and foster innovation and security.', 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Industry,Information and Communication Technologies,Education,Water Resources'}\n",

Crumbling facilities, absentee teachers, and roads to nowhere waste resources and retard development in many countries around the world. These failures in last mile service delivery underscore a more intractable development problem, a breakdown in accountability relationships, as politicians and civil servants act with impunity to extract private benefits at the expense of public goods. This study examines the extent to which technology and transparency can disrupt this low accountability status quo through turning information into collective action to improve government performance by strengthening the accountability relationships between politicians, service providers and citizens. In 2010, a new president came to power in the Philippines with a compelling message, ‘no corruption, no poverty’, and embraced open government as a vehicle to burn avenues of retreat and advance governance reforms. This study features examples from five sectors, education, reconstruction, roads, municipal development, and tax collection – where government champions sought to open up the black box of service delivery and use digital platforms to disclose data and strengthen accountability. This research provides guidance for public, private, and civil society leaders committed to using technology and transparency to curb pork-barrel politics and create digital dividends for their communities.

In a second step, using gravity analysis, the study estimates whether countries sharing the same data model exhibit higher or lower digital services trade compared to countries with different regulatory data models. The results show that sharing the open data model for cross-border data transfers is positively associated with trade in digital services, while sharing the conditional model for domestic data processing is also positively correlated with trade in digital services.

To date there is no widely accepted approach for storing and sharing such risk-related data using a common data structure. As a result, using risk-related data often requires a significant amount of upfront work to collect, extract and transform data before it can be used for purposes such as a risk assessment. In addition, the lack of a consistent data structure hinders the development of tools that can be used for more than one set of data. In practice, this situation introduces a significant amount of friction in efforts to quantify and manage disaster risk. Here we report on an effort by three consortia to develop extensible, internally consistent schemas for hazard, exposure and vulnerability data. The consortia coordinated their efforts so the three schemas are compatible. For example, the intensity measure types used to define the hazard datasets are compatible with the intensity measures used by the vulnerability models. Similarly, the asset attributes used in the exposure data taxonomy are compatible with the asset attributes used for the vulnerability data. Hazard data can be provided as either event footprints or stochastic catalogs. Exposure classes include buildings, infrastructure, agriculture, livestock, forestry and socio-economic data. The vulnerability component includes fragility and vulnerability functions and indicators for physical and social vulnerability. The schemas also provide the ability to define uncertainties associated with the hazard data and allows the scoring of vulnerability data for relevance and quality.

The aim is to enable a more deliberate approach to building information systems that can serve as a global public good, rather than reinventing the wheel every time. Despite business processes being largely the same in various country contexts, each new project is typically built from scratch, as if there were no templates, code libraries or models, or lessons learned on which to base new implementations. Implementations in some domains are dominated by a few IT vendors that present significant switching costs and lock-in to governments that are already resource constrained. OSS solutions have the potential to address the challenges mentioned above and facilitate efficiency, robustness, security, and interoperability of information systems. Governments in the digital age are interested to learn how OSS solutions can help build open, robust, interoperable, and secure service delivery platforms. Digital technology is increasingly the way citizens interact with government. From submitting passport applications to paying parking tickets and registering for social assistance, prior in-person interactions are now occurring online. For governments, modern identification (ID) systems allow for more efficient and transparent administration and service delivery, a reduction in fraud and leakage related to transfers and benefits payments, increased security, accurate vital statistics for planning purposes, and greater capacity to respond to disasters and epidemics. Equally important, social protection systems, programs, and policies help buffer individuals from shocks and equip them to improve their livelihoods and create opportunities to build a better life for themselves and their families.', 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Social Protections and Labor,Governance,Information and Communication Technologies'}\n",

In the Caribbean, considered one of the most vulnerable regions in the world, governments face two fundamental decisions when it comes to disaster risk reduction: where and how to build. Answers to both these questions should rely on disaster risk analyses to inform where and how to build safer, less vulnerable structures. Risk analyses can also be used to take corrective measures to reduce risk of existing structures in order to protect citizens and investments against damage and economic losses caused by natural hazards. Without access to quality geospatial data, it is impossible to do good risk analyses. The prioritization process will help in making decisions on where to invest scarce financial resources in order to most efficiently reduce vulnerability and create climate resilience. By improving access to geospatial data management, governments are better able to conduct risk analyses to inform decisions that move the Caribbean towards building disaster and climate resilience.', 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Science and Technology Development,Information and Communication Technologies,Urban Development,Education,Private Sector Development'}\n",

            "{'id': '28015672', 'abstract': 'This evaluation’s objective was to assess how effectively the World Bank has supported development data production, sharing, and use, and to suggest ways to improve its approach. This evaluation defines development data as data produced by country systems, the World Bank, or third parties on countries’ social, economic, and environmental issues. At the global level, the World Bank has a strong reputation in development data and has been highly effective in data production. It produces influential, widely used data and cross-country indicators that fill important niches, benchmark countries, and stimulate research and policy action. The World Bank has also taken a prominent leadership role in global data partnerships so far. However, the World Bank needs to determine its future role carefully because the global partnership landscape is becoming more uncertain—as old partnerships phase out, the complementarity of new partnerships is unclear. This makes the World Bank’s future role especially pivotal because the sustainability of funding from global data partnerships at both the national level and for some global data efforts is at risk. Without sustained funding, past progress will be in jeopardy, as observed in some countries where data quality worsened when trust fund support ended. At the national level, the World Bank has been mostly effective at fostering its client countries’ data production through its own financing and through financing from small trust fund grants. It has been less effective in promoting data sharing; while the World Bank has used its leverage in some of its client countries, it needs to do a better job at encouraging other countries to share data. The World Bank has been even less effective in promoting data use by governments and citizens. The World Bank’s systemwide approach to building the capacity of national statistical organizations yielded significant successes in countries where it was deployed, and it should now add a focus on building subnational capacity and strengthening client countries’ administrative data systems. The World Bank needs to make sure it clearly understands when and how big data can complement traditional data in answering key development questions related to its mission, and use big data analytics appropriately to underpin its own decisions and to ensure that it supports its country clients effectively in big data use. The World Bank still needs to address the implications for organizing big data work internally, entering into corporate agreements with private providers (typically the producers of big data), and seriously considering and addressing privacy and ethical concerns related to big data use.', 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Information and Communication Technologies,Health, Nutrition and Population,Social Protections and Labor,Poverty Reduction'}\n",

Mobile, social media and geo-spatial channels provide reach and connection mechanisms that were unheard of ten years ago. The costs for using these technologies have fallen in the last few years and a new movement to make ICT for development effective has grown. With the emergence of volunteer technical communities and open data platforms, collective action by providers and users has developed to strengthen reporting, accountability, redress and reforms. Active in this movement of enablers, the World Bank Institute (WBI) connects prac¬titioners, networks and institutions to help them find solutions to their development challenges. With a focus on the ‘how’ of reform, WBI links knowledge from around the world and scales up innovations. The WBI Procurement team is working on a program on procurement reforms in fragile and conflict-affected states. In collaboration with country partners in the Network for Integrity in Reconstruction, Integrity Action and WBI have produced this research on information and communication technology (ICT) tools to inform open contracting in fragile and conflict-affected settings. The following report identifies efforts to use ICT, from the use of mobile technology to open data portals, for fairer and more inclusive, transparent and accountable public resource management. Drawing on available literature and interviews with practitioners and users in fragile and conflict-affected countries1, the research identifies approaches to ICT that can lead to real impact in fragile and conflict-affected countries. The research maps innovative tools and captures challenges and implications for the use of ICT tools for open contracting in situations of conflict and fragility. It is important to note that this study provides an overview of tools and emerging lessons as ICT-enhanced accountability is still a new approach in many fragile and conflict-affected states and a topic that has only recently emerged in analytical literature.

            "{'id': '23110254', 'abstract': 'This report stemmed from a World Bank pilot activity to explore the potential of big data to address development challenges in Central American countries. As part of this activity we collected and analyzed a number of examples of leveraging big data for development. Because of the growing interest in this topic this report makes available to a broader audience those examples as well as the underlying conceptual framework to think about big data for development. To make effective use of big data, many practitioners emphasize the importance of beginning with a question instead of the data itself. A question clarifies the purpose of utilizing big data, whether it is for awareness, understanding, and/or forecasting. In addition, a question suggests the kinds of real-world behaviors or conditions that are of interest. These behaviors are encoded into data through some generating process which includes the media through which behavior is captured. Then various data sources are accessed, prepared, consolidated and analyzed. This ultimately gives rise to insights into the question of interest, which are implemented to effect changes in the relevant behaviors. Utilizing big data for any given endeavor requires a host of capabilities. Hardware and software capabilities are needed for interaction of data from a variety of sources in a way which is efficient and scalable. Human capabilities are needed not only to make sense of data but to ensure a question-centered approach, so that insights are actionable and relevant. To this end, cooperation between development experts as well as social scientists and computer scientists is extremely important.', 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Information and Communication Technologies,Finance and Financial Sector Development'}\n",

            "{'id': '32184006', 'abstract': 'Like Dar es Salaam, many large cities face major transport challenges due to the continuous growth of the urban population, private vehicle ownership, congestion, and the fragility of public transportation systems. Transport can become a constraint on both economic growth and social development and inclusion, along with increased negative impacts on health and on the environment. Because of the increasing use of modern technology, transportation has become a data-rich industry. By bringing the data together, and by using open formats, the data can be used for innovative applications to help relieve urban traffic congestion, to improve the provision and operation of public transport services, and to reduce environmental damage with the goal of improving the lives of citizens. The use of data enables transport planners, operators, and users to obtain additional economic, social, and environmental benefits from the physical transport investment and infrastructure. This report shows that Dar es Salaam is on the cusp of a transport data revolution. Generally, the conclusions are that there are no major blocks to progress, but in many areas, there is a lot of work that will need to be done over time.', 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Information and Communication Technologies,Urban Development,Transport,Industry'}\n",
            "{'id': '30837721', 'abstract': 'Rural accessibility is the only metric used in the Sustainable Development Goals to track progress toward better transport services in low- and middle-income countries. This paper estimates the rural accessibility index, defined as the proportion of the rural population who live within 2 kilometers of an all-season road, in 166 countries using open data. It then explores the cost of increasing the rural accessibility index in 19 countries, using an algorithm that prioritizes rural roads investments based on their impact on rural access and connectivity. Investment costs quickly balloon as the rural accessibility index increases, questioning the affordability of universal access to paved roads for many countries by 2030. If countries spent 1 percent of their gross domestic product annually on the upgrade of rural roads, even under optimistic assumptions on growth of gross domestic product, rural accessibility would only increase from 39 to 52 percent by 2030 across all developing countries. Alternative solutions to rural integration must thus be implemented in the short run until countries can afford to increase significantly access to all weather roads. For example, drones that supply regular food and medicine supply to remote communities are much more affordable than roads in the short term.', 'last_modified_date': '2019-03-06T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Rural Development,Transport,Urban Development,Environment'}\n",

The paper shows that the new data can serve as meaningful proxies for the overall transparency of governments and the new data have explanatory power for the quality of business regulation. The paper finds the regulatory environment to be most opaque in Sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East and North Africa, where businesses can often only access basic regulatory information by meeting a government official. By contrast, in countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and Eastern Europe and Central Asia, access is more direct via websites, public billboards, and brochures. Moreover, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development economies are more consistent in their transparency efforts across government agencies. The paper also finds that while resources as proxied by income levels play some role in explaining why some economies make more information easily accessible than others, those resources are not the only determining factor; regardless of income, more democratic governments tend to make greater transparency efforts. Finally, easier access to basic regulatory information is associated with greater regulatory quality and less corruption.', 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Public Sector Development,Private Sector Development,Law and Development,Governance'}\n",

Data production, sharing, and use are the three focus areaswithin the first block of WBG’s Development Data Framework. More recently, the Bank’s role in development data is evident in the establishment of theData Council in July 2014 and in the World Bank Group Strategic Actions Program forAddressing Development Data Gaps: 2016 - 2030 (World Bank, 2016). The latter aims to reducethe gaps in the quantity and quality of development data in Bank client countries, and toencourage Bank clients to adopt data innovations that are scalable and proven to reduce the costand time of data production, while preserving data quality. The Bank’s strategic approach to development data for 2016-2030 forward has been informed by the challenges facing the Bank’s work on development data.

Most discussants agree that for true transparency, it is important not only that governments publish budget data on websites, but that the data they disclose are meaningful and provide a full picture of their financial activities to the public. Most governments have made substantial investments in capacity building and technology for the development of Financial Management Information Systems (FMIS). This study is the first attempt to explore the effects of FMIS on publishing open budget data, identify potential improvements in budget transparency, and provide some guidance on the effective use of FMIS platforms to publish open budget data. Overall, there are only 48 countries (24 percent) where civil society and citizens have the opportunity to benefit from Public Finance (PF) information published on the web to monitor the budget and hold their governments accountable. In many countries, external audit organizations do not appear to be using the FMIS platforms effectively for monitoring the government's financial activities or auditing the budget results. Governments in high-and middle-income economies publish budget data dynamically in various formats, mainly from centralized systems, while many lower-income economies tend to publish static budget data, mostly through documents posted on PF websites. The study shows that only a small group of countries provide good access to reliable open budget data from underlying FMIS solutions. Many governments publish substantial information on their PF websites, but the contents are (not always) meaningful to provide adequate answers to the question, 'Where does the money go?' Therefore, the main conclusion of this study is that when it comes to government PF websites, what you see is (not always) what you get. Many governments need to make additional efforts that will build confidence in the budget data they disclose. As citizens and civil society increasingly demand access to open data about all financial activities, governments around the world are trying to respond to this democratic pressure. The outputs of this study are expected to provide a comprehensive view of the status of government practices for publishing budget data around the world, and to promote debates around the improvement of PF web publishing platforms to support transparency, accountability, and participation by disclosing reliable information about all financial activities.\", 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Social Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Finance and Financial Sector Development'}\n",

The global financial crisis has prompted many governments to seek efficiency savings in order to reduce budget deficits and restore medium-term structural balance without harming long-term growth prospects or service quality. To reap savings from inefficiencies, governments must be able to identify such inefficiencies and examine their root causes. One way of doing so is through analytical work that sheds light on where in the budget more can be done with less the process starts by gathering detailed government expenditure data directly from a country's treasury system. By requesting raw data at the most disaggregated level available, the resulting BOOST database takes advantage of the full breadth and depth of the country's budget classification system. The data on expenditures, organized using all of the country's budget classification codes, is then compiled in one database that covers all sectors, all spending units, and all types of expenditures recorded in the treasury system.

World Development Report 2021: Data for Better Lives explores the tremendous potential of the changing data landscape to improve the lives of poor people, while also acknowledging its potential to open back doors that can harm individuals, businesses, and societies. To address this tension between the helpful and harmful potential of data, this Report calls for a new social contract that enables the use and reuse of data to create economic and social value, ensures equitable access to that value, and fosters trust that data will not be misused in harmful ways. This Report begins by assessing how better use and reuse of data can enhance the design of public policies, programs, and service delivery, as well as improve market efficiency and job creation through private sector growth. Because better data governance is key to realizing this value, the Report then looks at how infrastructure policy, data regulation, economic policies, and institutional capabilities enable the sharing of data for their economic and social benefits, while safeguarding against harmful outcomes. The Report concludes by pulling together the pieces and offering an aspirational vision of an integrated national data system that would deliver on the promise of producing high-quality data and making them accessible in a way that promotes their safe use and reuse.

The policy variable is a quantitative measure of the commitments under international agreements. The paper analyzes, for the first time, not only bilateral agreements, but also plurilateral agreements such as the one among Arab states. The analysis finds that more liberal policy is associated with greater passenger traffic between countries. Higher traffic levels appear to be driven by larger numbers of city pairs being served, as well as by more passengers traveling along given routes. To demonstrate the quantitative implication of the estimates, two liberalization scenarios in the Middle East are evaluated. Deepening the plurilateral agreement among Arab states would lead to a 30 percent increase in intraregional passenger traffic. Widening the agreement to include Turkey will generate significantly larger gains because current policy vis-a-vis Turkey is much more restrictive.', 'last_modified_date': '2018-05-28T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'International Economics and Trade,Transport'}\n",

The current account surplus has declined (1Q 2017: 1.6 percent of GDP; 4Q 2016: 3.8 percent of GDP) due to strong import growth. Gross imports growth, mainly of capital and intermediate goods, outpaced the significant increase in gross exports, resulting in a lower goods surplus. The current account surplus is projected to narrow further to 1.6 percent of GDP in 2017. Monetary policy is expected to remain accommodative and supportive for growth.

But how important are such restrictions for passenger traffic This paper uses detailed data on worldwide passenger aviation to estimate the effect of air transport policy on international air traffic. The policy variable is a quantitative measure of the commitments under international agreements. The paper analyzes, for the first time, not only bilateral agreements, but also plurilateral agreements such as the one between Arab states. The analysis finds that more liberal policy is associated with greater passenger traffic between countries. Higher traffic levels appear to be driven primarily by larger numbers of city pairs being served, rather than by more passengers traveling along given routes. To demonstrate the quantitative implication of the estimates, two liberalization scenarios in the Middle East are evaluated. Deepening the plurilateral agreement among Arab states would lead to a 30 percent increase in intraregional passenger traffic. Widening the agreement to include Turkey would generate significantly larger gains because current policy vis-à-vis Turkey is much more restrictive.', 'last_modified_date': '2019-05-05T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Public Sector Development,Transport,Environment'}\n",
            "{'id': '697929', 'abstract': 'The authors show how two-sector models can be used to derive policy lessons about adjustment in developing economies. In the past two decades, changes in the external environment and in economic policies have been the key factors in the performance of developing economies. By and large the shocks have involved the external sector: terms-of-trade shocks or cutbacks in foreign capital. The policy responses most commonly proposed have targeted the external sector: depreciating the real exchange rate or reducing distortionary taxes to make the economy more competitive. The authors provide a starting point for analyzing the relation between external shocks and policy responses. Starting from a small, one-country, two-sector, three-good (1-2-3) model, the authors outline how the effects of a foreign capital inflow and terms-of-trade shock can be analyzed. They derive the assumptions underlying the conventional policy recommendation of real exchange rate depreciation in response to adverse shocks. The implications of such trade and fiscal policy instruments as export subsidies, import tariffs, and domestic indirect taxes can also be studied in this framework. The authors show that the standard advice to depreciate the real exchange rate in the wake of an adverse terms-of-trade shock rests on the condition that the income effect of the external shock dominates its substitution effect. But, depending on the characteristics of the economy (for example, the trade elasticities), policy results may run counter to received wisdom. For example, when the substitution effect of an adverse external shock dominates, real depreciation is inappropriate. An infusion of foreign capital does not necessarily benefit the nontradable sector, as the results of \"Dutch disease\" models suggest (for example, in the extreme case of nearly infinite substitution elasticity between imports and domestic goods). When import tariffs are significant sources of public revenue, potential revenue losses from tariff cuts must be offset by other revenue sources to maintain the external current account balance. The paper shows a simple way to calculate the necessary tax adjustment. A major advantage of small models is their simplicity. The example in this paper can be solved analytically - either graphically or algebraically. It also can be solved numerically, using such widely available PC-based spreadsheet programs as Excel. The numerical implementation involves only modest data requirements. The data that governments normally release on national income, fiscal, and balance of payments accounts are sufficient.', 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Environment'}\n",

The resulting model is used to predict whether the other units in the country are urban or rural in practice. Contrary to frequent claims, India is not substantially more urban than implied by census data. And the speed of urbanization is only marginally higher than official statistics suggest.

While improving data transparency alone reduces the external borrowing costs for a country, the return is much higher when combined with stronger institutional quality and lower public and external debt. Similarly, the returns on investing in data transparency are higher when a country's integration to the global economy deepens, as captured by trade and financial openness. Estimation of an instrumental variable regression shows that Sub-Saharan African countries could have saved up to 14.5 basis points in sovereign bond spreads and decreased their external debt burden by US$405.4 million (0.02 percent of gross domestic product) in 2018, if their average level of data transparency was that of a country in the top quartile of the upper-middle-income country category.

But the flow of personal data outside the jurisdiction of national regulators also raises concerns about the protection of privacy. Addressing these legitimate concerns without undermining international integration is a challenge. This paper describes and assesses three types of responses to this challenge: unilateral development of national or regional regulation, such as the European Union's Data Protection Directive and forthcoming General Data Protection Regulation; international negotiation of trade disciplines, most recently in the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP); and international cooperation involving regulators, most significantly in the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Agreement. The paper argues that unilateral restrictions on data flows are costly and can hurt exports, especially of data-processing and other data-based services; international trade rules that limit only the importers' freedom to regulate cannot address the challenge posed by privacy; and regulatory cooperation that aims at harmonization and mutual recognition is not likely to succeed, given the desirable divergence in national privacy regulation. The way forward is to design trade rules (as the CPTPP seeks to do) that reflect the bargain central to successful international cooperation (as in the EU-US Privacy Shield): regulators in data destination countries would assume legal obligations to protect the privacy of foreign citizens in return for obligations on data source countries not to restrict the flow of data. Existing multilateral rules can help ensure that any such arrangements do not discriminate against and are open to participation by other countries.\", 'last_modified_date': '2018-05-08T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Law and Development,Information and Communication Technologies,International Economics and Trade'}\n",

WSP has utilized a conceptual framework, called sanitation focus, opportunity, ability, motivation (Sani- FOAM), to help program managers and implementers analyze sanitation behaviors to inform effective sanitation programs. Three specific sanitation behaviors are covered in the review: open defecation, acquisition of toilets, and improvement of latrines. This review collects the results from formative quantitative and qualitative research reports and presentations from eight countries: Cambodia, India (Rajasthan, Meghalaya, and Bihar), Indonesia (East Java), Kenya, Malawi, Peru, Tanzania, and Uganda. Studies were conducted from 2006 until 2012. The studies reviewed used a variety of methods, including focus group discussions, in-depth interviews, and structured interviews using questionnaires. The review followed standard qualitative methodologies of thematic ordering and interpretation to identify factors that can positively or negatively influence the behaviors of interest. Findings presented in this report illustrate themes that were consistently found across regions and countries. The most salient factors influencing rural sanitation behaviors that emerged from the review include access to and availability of functioning latrines, sanitation products, and services; latrine product attributes (for example, perceptions of cleanliness and durability); social norms around open defecation; perceptions of latrine affordability; self-efficacy to build latrines; and competing priorities for other household items. The review also identified a number of emotional, social, and physical drivers. These include shame and embarrassment associated with open defecation, as well as perceptions of improved social status, privacy, and convenience associated with latrine ownership and use.', 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Rural Development,Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources'}\n",

This book examines five small open economies - Hong Kong, Singapore, Jamaica, Mauritius, and Malta - and traces how they dealt with the opportunities and challenges of the postcolonial world. Through a comparative study of their social, political, and economic structures and development, the authors attempt to account for differences in the growth performance of these economies over the latter part of the twentieth century. No one path has proved to be a sure road to success. The resource-poor city-states of Hong Kong and Singapore - one with a laissez-faire government, the other more interventionist - have prospered economically while improving their distribution of income. Jamaica, despite its agricultural and mineral resources, has been the least successful, perhaps because competing parties have pushed redistribution at the expense of growth. Mauritius, a multiethnic society, has turned to manufactured exports and tourism as an alternative to reliance on sugar production. Malta overcame the shock of losing a British naval base and has grown rapidly.

Using the gravity model, they conduct an econometric analysis of trade flows between major trading countries. They estimate bilateral trade flow equations using a data set for 45 countries over 12 years and then use those equations to study the contribution of trading blocs to intra-regionnal trade. Past investigators have estimated the gravity equation using data for total trade, pooling data across countries. The authors estimate separate equations for the exports and imports of 22 countries (nine in East Asia, six in Europe, three in North America, two in South America, and one in Oceania). Using 27 countries outside of North America, East Asia, and the founding members of the European Union (EEC) as the control countries, the authors test for each region's openness to trade with outside countries. They conclude that: 1) results based on individual-country equations differ greatly from those obtained from pooled, cross-country equations. In some cases, this difference is qualitative. Not surprisingly, in virtually all cases the cross-country equation masks large differences among countries. The coefficient asscociated with distance, for example, varies between -4.4 and -0.4 across the authors' equations. In almost every case the coefficient is statistically significant at a confidence level of 99 percent or more; 2) If there is an intra-regional bias in trade, it is more in North America and among the founding members of the European Union than in East Asia. Canada, the United States, and all countries of the EEC show an intra-regional bias in both exports and imports. In East Asia, on the other hand, exports in six out of nine countries have a statistically significant bias away from intra-regional markets; 3) There is little support for the hypothesis that East Asian markets are closed to trade with outside countries; and 4) Contrary to conventional wisdom, controlling for other variables, many countries export less to North America than to countries outside the three regions.

The empirics employ a variety of econometric estimators, including dynamic panel and cross-sectional instrumental variables estimators, with the latter approach yielding a higher estimated elasticity.

Following the exercise, a new microdata access indicator that measures the degree of opennes of microdata and the ease with which microdata users can understand and navigate the websites of national statistical offices is presented. The results show that about half of the expected core data sets are being collected and that only a fraction is made available publicly. As a consequence, many summary statistics, including national accounts and welfare estimates, are outdated and of limited relevance to decision makers. Additional investments in microdata collection and publication of the data once collected are strongly advised.

Economic theory generally implies that trade liberalization will improve economic growth, and the two phenomena are positively correlated in empirical tests, but the connection is not well-substantiated in numerical general equilibrium models. In the authors' model, an intermediate input affects aggregate output through a Dixit-Stiglitz function. Additional varieties provide the engine of growth in this framework and the existence of this mechanism magnifies the welfare costs. In this model with lump sum revenue replacement, reducing a tariff from 20 percent to 10 percent produces a welfare increase (in terms of Hicksian equivalent variation over the infinite horizon) of 10.7 percent of the present value of consumption in their central model, where the economy is assumed to be unable to borrow on international financial markets. If macroeconomic and financial reforms are in place that would allow international borrowing, however, the same tariff cut is estimated to result in a 37 percent increase in Hicksian equivalent variation. On the other hand, if inefficient replacement taxes must be used in an economy without the capacity to borrow internationally, the gains would be reduced to 4.7 percent. Larger tariff cuts--typical of those in many developing countries over the past 30 years--produce larger estimated welfare gains at least proportionate to the size of the cut. The authors apply the model to five developing countries and estimate the impact of the tariff changes those countries plan to undertake as part of Uruguay Round commitments. Because of the dynamic effects, estimated gains are considerably larger than those found in the literature on the impact of the Uruguay Round.\", 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Poverty Reduction'}\n",

Regressions show that in countries that have more restrictive data policies, firms are less likely to use foreign technologies through licensing as part of their innovation process. Country-specific cases for which data are available also show that restrictive data policies are negatively associated with firms' likelihood of using intangible assets, such as patents and goodwill, for performing innovation (in Malaysia and China) and developing innovations as a result of research and development that are new to the market (in Vietnam).

In contrast to literature on the developmental state, however, argues that these agencies were located the periphery of the public sector, with few hard resources. The paper describes how their peripheral location facilitated successful experimentation. It also explains how ostensibly marginal agencies could successfully scale and monitor new initiatives. More specifically, it argues that reform-oriented policy-makers in small states could leverage extensive inter-personal networks to facilitate scaling and international openness to facilitate monitoring. In identifying specific mechanisms by which policy-makers introduced, scaled and monitored policies, it also explains why these two historically innovative economies have struggled to support experimentation in recent years.', 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Culture and Development,Private Sector Development,Information and Communication Technologies,Industry,Finance and Financial Sector Development'}\n",

Yet, the understanding of the role of dairy production in livelihoods and nutritional outcomes is hindered by the lack of decent quality household survey data. Data on milk off-take for human consumption are difficult to collect in household surveys for several reasons that make accurate recall challenging for the respondent (continuous production and seasonality, among others). As a result, the quantification and valuation of milk off-take is particularly difficult in household surveys, introducing possibly severe biases in the computation of full household incomes and farm sales, as well as in the estimation of the contribution of livestock (specifically dairy) production in agricultural value added and the livelihoods of rural households. This paper presents results from a validation exercise implemented in Niger, where alternative survey instruments based on recall methods were administered to randomly selected households and compared with a 12-month system of physical monitoring and recording of milk production. The results of the exercise show that reasonably accurate estimates via recall methods are possible and provide a clear ranking of questionnaire design options that can inform future survey operations.', 'last_modified_date': '2020-05-20T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Agriculture,Social Protections and Labor,Law and Development,Poverty Reduction,Health, Nutrition and Population'}\n",

Recent approaches focusing on climate impacts and land use pressures (climate-smart agriculture and landscape approach) add to the complexity and require efficient data collection and analysis methods. The systemization of information and communication technology (ICT) in the monitoring and evaluation (M and E) process enables accountability- from field staff to regional and central governments and development partners. The leapfrog effects of ICT have increased access to quality information, eased knowledge sharing among practitioners and resource-constrained governments, and created opportunities to improve accountability. The expansion of ICT has also made the work of development practitioners easier and more accurate. In some regions there are already more mobile phone subscriptions than people, and even internet access has become more common. This report identifies where ICT has expanded the capacity to perform good M and E and, more importantly, it identifies where it has not. It identifies where and how it can expand data collection and M and E, but also why and how technology is not a replacement for human agency and involvement in analysis and interpretation tasks. This report seeks to present solutions to some of the questions concerning data collection and M and E. It is designed to be an operational piece that addresses how governments and practitioners can use ICT to improve their data collection and M&E efforts in rural development projects. The first section gives overview. The second section of the report focuses on the most important aspect of ICT use: articulating the needs of the project and users. The third section provides an overview of five models currently used to implement and integrate information technology into M and E efforts. The crux of the report centers on choosing the right product or set of products for the project, and it includes cross-comparative guidance on application features such as data validation, offline capacity, dashboards, and built-in analytics in section four.

This paper assesses, and attempts to mitigate, selection biases in individual-level analyses based on phone survey data. The research uses data from (i) national phone surveys that have been implemented in Ethiopia, Malawi, Nigeria, and Uganda during the pandemic, and (ii) the pre-COVID-19 national face-to-face surveys that served as the sampling frames for the phone surveys. The availability of pre-COVID-19 face-to-face survey data permits comparisons of phone survey respondents with the general adult population. Phone survey respondents are more likely to be household heads or their spouses and non-farm enterprise owners, and on average, are older and better educated vis-à-vis the general adult population. To improve the representativeness of individual-level phone survey data, the household-level phone survey sampling weights are calibrated based on propensity score adjustments that are derived from a model of an individual’s likelihood of being interviewed as a function of individual- and household-level attributes. Reweighting improves the representativeness of the estimates for the phone survey respondents, moving them closer to those of the general adult population. This holds for women and men and a range of demographic, education, and labor market outcomes. However, reweighting increases the variance of the estimates and fails to overcome selection biases. Obtaining reliable data on men and women through phone surveys requires random selection of adult interviewees within sampled households.', 'last_modified_date': '2021-05-13T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Information and Communication Technologies,Education,Gender'}\n",

In a development project setting, it is seldom feasible to collect full consumption data for estimating the poverty impacts. While survey-to-survey imputation is a cost-effective approach to address these gaps, its effective use calls for a combination of both ex-ante design choices and ex-post modeling efforts that are anchored in validated protocols. This paper refines various aspects of existing poverty imputation models using 14 multi-topic household surveys conducted over the past decade in Ethiopia, Malawi, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Vietnam. The analysis reveals that including an additional predictor that captures household utility consumption expenditures—as part of a basic imputation model with household-level demographic and employment variables—provides poverty estimates that are not statistically significantly different from the true poverty rates. In many cases, these estimates even fall within one standard error of the true poverty rates. Adding geospatial variables to the imputation model improves imputation accuracy on a cross-country basis. Bringing in additional community-level predictors (available from survey and census data in Vietnam) related to educational achievement, poverty, and asset wealth can further enhance accuracy. Yet, there is within-country spatial heterogeneity in model performance, with certain models performing well for either urban areas or rural areas only.

This paper illustrates that this assumption of comparability is potentially invalid when households are interviewed multiple times with repeat visits throughout the year. The paper provides an example from Jordan, where the internationally comparable approach of handling the data from repeat visits yields a poverty rate that is 26 percent greater than the rate that is currently reported as the official estimate. The paper also explores alternative definitions of poverty, informed in part by the psychological and biophysical literature on the long-run effects of short-term exposure to poverty or generally adverse environments.

Large-scale education reform efforts in Romania have been very unique in that they were not based on a shared vision for a need for change among education stakeholders. Reform goals were better clarified and refined in the process of developing different sub-sector-based reforms initiated as a result of needs analyses and strategic planning by the Ministry of Education in cooperation with specific partners and donors. International partnerships have been of crucial importance for the success of the Romanian education reform. Education projects undertaken in cooperation with international bodies have not only ensured the necessary financial resources, but have also provided important technical assistance and tremendously contributed to local personnel and institutional capacity building.', 'last_modified_date': '2019-05-04T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Gender,Education'}\n",
            "{'id': '19123216', 'abstract': \"Open defecation within a community harms the physical and cognitive development of children, even children living in households that use toilets themselves. Frequently digesting feces due to poor sanitation can cause diarrhea, malnutrition, and stunted growth-and thus impact negatively on a child's cognitive development. Experiencing these health hazards at young ages can ultimately limit one's earning potential later in life. In addition to the use of health services, mother and child nutrition practices and care, the immediate disease environment shapes early life health and ultimately a child's achievement later in life. Thus, elimination of open defecation makes a sensible priority for policy makers that are concerned with the next productive generation. This brief shows, the level of open defecation in a community is associated with shorter children in Cambodia. Moreover, the level of open defecation in a community is more important for a child's development than whether the child's household itself openly defecates. By looking at the change in defecation levels and average child height between 2005 and 2010 within Cambodian provinces, the study is able to show that improvements in sanitation access played a substantial role in increasing average child height over the same five years.\", 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Water Supply and Sanitation,Health, Nutrition and Population,Poverty Reduction'}\n",

The main objectives pursued by regulatory frameworks that define open banking are generally encouraging innovation and fostering competition, resulting in new products and services at competitive prices to the benefit of consumers. With that in mind, and with the United Kingdom as a first mover, different regulatory approaches have been developed. Some of them are regulatory driven, while in other cases, with a hands-off approach, they have been led by industry. In between, we also find collaborative models in which both the public sector and private-party players are instrumental to the definition and adoption of open banking. Regulatory approaches also differ in the scope of data that is to be shared, the definition of the financial institutions that have to publish their application programming inter-faces and share data, the mandatory or voluntary nature of the framework, the definition of the type of license that third-party providers need to operate, and the definition or not of concrete standards, among other things. While there is no single right approach, there are common challenges that countries considering regulation certainly need to bear in mind in terms of the definition and interoperability of technical standards, security, governance, and consent and authentication mechanisms. Although open-banking regulatory frameworks have been operating for less than two years at most, early lessons can be drawn from the first movers and the debates that are taking place between regulators and market participants.', 'last_modified_date': '2022-06-01T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'N/A'}\n",

This dilemma underscores the paucity of consolidated information on CAPI software.

The challenge, then, is not simply to identify CAPI software packages, but to find ones that are robust enough in performance and broad enough in functionality to support a complex household survey. This report's approach towards the fulfillment of the informational gap is to search for software, screen for suitability, develop a rating system, and evaluate the packages.

Their citizens are expecting everhigher standards of service and want to be able to interact with the government online as easily as they do with banks and Internet commerce companies. At the same time, governments need to reduce administrative costs and increase program effectiveness. For many years, &#8220;e-Government&#8221; has been a major contributor to meeting these challenges. In recent years Russia has made good progress on its existing e-Government strategy for providing digital services in parallel with other channels. To assist the Government of the Russian Federation with its plans to develop and launch a project that will be designed to address these issues and move the country towards a Digital Government, this report from the World Bank team sets out high level recommendations that are tailored to the needs of Russia, and that are in line with the best international practices. The analysis shows that the situation with the monitoring of e-Government development in the Russian Federation as a whole is not bad. There are large amounts of data on various aspects of using ICT for public administration and local self-government. Most of measurable indicators used in Russia, as in many other countries, relate to assessments of the level of e-Readiness of the country, and of particular regions or industries. To conclude, for Russia, as well as for other countries, there is a challenge to create a new system of monitoring for the use of ICT for public administration in the context of proper Digital Government maturity models.', 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Education,Information and Communication Technologies'}\n",

Compared to previous welfare dynamic prediction methods, the LASSO-PMM makes fewer and less restrictive assumptions and allows estimating poverty transitions and income changes. We validate the method using 36 harmonized panel data sets in four Latin American countries and then apply it to cross-section data from 43 countries across the world. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that uses these many datasets to validate and estimate welfare and mobility predictions. Validation results indicate that LASSO-PMM predictions are in general statistically indistinguishable from actual household poverty rates, mobility indicators, and income or consumption changes; results which are further supported by a series of sensitivity tests and robustness checks. These findings are sufficiently encouraging to suggest that estimating economic mobility using a LASSO-PMM approach may accurately approximate actual welfare dynamics in settings where panel data are unavailable.

In addition to data on export and import flows, calculation of trade costs using the inverse gravity methodology also requires information on domestic production in each country.

In response, commercial data providers are continually developing solutions to improve insight. Here the authors discuss one of these potential improvements: the use of geospatial data within ESG focusing on the environmental (E) aspect. Geospatial data can, and is, being used for social (S), and governance (G) purposes, but these are beyond the scope of this paper. This paper explores and tests with real-world examples the potential of geospatial data approaches as means to provide additional insights into the environmental impacts of specific assets, companies, states or nations for sovereign debt investment. Starting with the current data landscape, the document runs through the open ‘environmental’ geospatial data portfolio, outlining its strengths and weaknesses. From this vantage point, the report outlines three case studies in Brazil across differing scales, highlighting various key metrics. The first looks at an asset level example, mining operations; secondly a corporate level example looking at soya production (where asset data is unavailable); and finally a national scale example for sovereign debt insights. Throughout the paper, commercial actors provide technical illustrations as to what more would be possible with additional resources. The document demonstrates that it is possible, even with limited resources and only open data, to generate robust geospatial ESG insights that often can be scaled globally – aiding financial institutions to better differentiate environmental impact at different scales and across different applications The paper concludes by discussing the various future technical developments, highlighting real-world developments, such as eDNA and machine learning, and their implications for the future of geospatial ESG. Finally, the authors look at a breakdown of the critical components of geospatial ESG tools, showing where they fall on a spectrum, with most underutilizing the technical toolkit available. As a result of this potential technical growth, combined with greater demand from the financial sector, they expect to see a rapid development of more refined geospatial ESG products and insights in the near future.', 'last_modified_date': '2022-02-24T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Environment,Water Resources,Industry'}\n",

            "{'id': '694957', 'abstract': \"Developing countries experienced a revolution in trade policy in the 1980s and 1990s, but it is unclear how much real openness increased. After all, they had started with multiple, often redundant, trade restrictions. And it is unclear how changes in openness should be measured. The most appropriate measure of openness is based on imports of consumer goods, argue the authors, since these imports commonly face the biggest trade barriers. After developing several such measures, including a measure of the change in tariff equivalent protection, they explore the recent evolution of trade policy, using readily available trade data. Openness has developed incrementally rather than overnight. In the early adjustment stages, barriers to imports tended not to be reduced much. At first, the net reduction of incentives to produce import substitutes was minor, especially when currency depreciation is considered. Recently import barriers have been reduced more substantially, and since there has been little currency depreciation, incentives to produce import substitutes have declined. Shock therapy was uncommon. A few countries moved quickly to eliminate nontariff barriers to imports and to adopt low, fairly uniform tariffs. But most countries tended to peel away redundant layers of trade barriers, one at a time. They usually began with the barriers embodied in rationing and exchange controls, proceeded to nontariff measures, and finally reduced tariffs. Each step may have reduced protection a bit but the big reductions apparently came only in later stages. Still, even gradual reform helped open up those economies. The Asian countries tended to be most open both early and late. They were also above-average in reform efforts, by some measures, so their strong growth performance (based on exports) was unsurprising. The African countries, whose trade policies were probably worst to begin with, made relatively modest progress initially. In recent years their progress has been substantial; whether they have improved as much as other countries depends on which measure is used. Countries tied to the French franc (for whom real devaluation was more difficult) showed less progress than nonfranc countries, illustrating the importance of the connection between devaluation and trade reform. There is no evidence that rapid trade reform resulted in Africa's de-industrialization.\", 'last_modified_date': '2001-04-21T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Poverty Reduction'}\n",

On average, an improvement in a country’s Statistical Capacity Index, a measure of data capacity and transparency, is associated with a decline in absolute forecast errors. A one standard deviation increase in the log of the Statistical Capacity Index is associated with a decline in absolute forecast errors by 0.44 percentage point for World Bank forecasts and 0.49 percentage point for International Monetary Fund forecasts. The results are robust to a battery of control variables and robustness checks. Fourth, the role of the overall data ecosystem, not just those elements related to gross domestic product growth forecasting, is important for the accuracy of gross domestic product growth forecasts.

Big data produced by online platforms can yield a wealth of diverse, highly granular, multidimensional information with a variety of potential applications. This paper examines how online job-portal data can be used as a basis for policy-relevant research in the fields of labor economics and workforce skills development, through an empirical analysis of information generated by Babajob, an online Indian job portal. The analysis highlights five key areas where online job-portal data can contribute to the development of labor market policies and analytical knowledge: (i) labor market monitoring and analysis; (ii) assessing demand for workforce skills; (iii) observing job-search behavior and improving skills matching; (iv) predictive analysis of skills demand; and (v) experimental studies. The unique nature of the data produced by online job-search portals allows for the application of diverse analytical methodologies, including descriptive data analysis, time-series analysis, text analysis, predictive analysis, and transactional data analysis. This paper is intended to contribute to the academic literature and the development of public policies. It contributes to the literature on labor economics through application of big data analytics to real-world data. The analysis also provides a unique case study on labor market data analytics in a developing-country context in South Asia. Finally, the report examines the potential for using big data to improve the design and implementation of labor market policies and promote demand-driven skills development.', 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Social Protections and Labor,Information and Communication Technologies,Rural Development,Education'}\n",

Emerging evidence shows tremendous gender disparities in the health and socioeconomic consequences of the pandemic, with a disproportionately negative impact on women’s livelihoods, unpaid care work burden, mental health, and subjection to gender-based violence. However, a lack of gender data impedes our ability to measure, preempt, and respond. Understanding the extent of these impacts is the first step toward reversing course. Filling these data gaps poses a significant challenge as many data collection efforts have been disrupted due to Coronavirus (COVID-19) control measures, impacting everything from data production to subsequent data management, analysis, use, and communication. The need for improved gender data is urgent, and responsibility for its generation spans different data systems and collection mechanisms, organizations, and mandates. However, in order to effectively inform policy and action, the global community of data producers, analysts, and users first needs adequate resources to provide timely, robust, and reliable evidence on the gender-differentiated impacts of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. It will also allow for the collection of more nuanced information for intersectional analyses and programming and create stronger, more resilient data infrastructures moving forward. Failing to meet this challenge could result in a gender-blind recovery that sets back rather than accelerates work to improve the status, rights, and opportunities for all.

The ultimate objective of the SRF and of the Catalytic Fund (SRF-CF) is to support better policy formulation and decision-making through sustained improvement in the production, availability and use of official statistics. It places a strong focus on statistical capacity building. This is the sixth annual report issued by the SRF-CF, which became operational in 2009. The report describes the SRF-CF approach, presents progress of the project activities over the period May 2014-May 2015, presents the revised Results Framework for the SRF as proposed by the 2014 SRF Evaluation, and defines the next steps for the SRF. The SRF draws heavily on lessons learned from the Sector-Wide Approach (SWAp) used successfully for a number of years in areas such as health, education and agriculture. This approach stresses the importance of supporting locally owned and locally led development programs, using country systems and procedures for implementation. Although statistics is not really a sector of activity in the same way as health or education, the National Strategy for the Development of Statistics (NSDS), which covers the national statistical system, provides a system-wide framework to deliver coordinated and harmonized financial and technical assistance. It focuses on strategic issues and coordination and supports the involvement of line ministries, relying on country leadership and ownership.

The model’s predictions produce country estimates of the number of articles using data that are highly correlated with a human-coded approach, with a correlation of 0.99. Analyzing more than 1 million academic articles, the paper finds that the number of articles on a country is strongly correlated with its gross domestic product per capita, population, and the quality of its national statistical system. The paper identifies data sources that are strongly associated with data-driven research and finds that availability of subnational data appears to be particularly important.

Since its inception, and with the support of the Australian government’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) and the United Kingdom’s Department for International Development (DFID), SABER has assisted countries in conducting a thorough inventory of their critical education policy gaps, based on global evidence of what works to improve learning. The SABER policy intent tools had been completed and applied in dozens of countries. The new phase of the SABER Trust Fund is focused on aspects of service delivery and the generation of broader metrics of education system performance. With new commitments from the Bill and Melina Gates Foundation (BMGF) and DFID, SABER has evolved from its focus from policy domain specific to a more holistic approach in 2018, as a response to governments’ greater attention to accelerating foundational learning and the WBG’s new education policy approach. The year 2019 marked the first year of the new phase of the SABER program, which has progressed to develop and provide technical assistance in relation to streamlined initiatives such as the Global Comparability of Learning Outcomes (GCLO), to make learning data from different assessments comparable across countries; the multidimensional Global Education Policy Dashboard (GEPD), to assess the capacity and performance of the education systems in client countries in terms of how well their practices (or service delivery), policies, and politics are oriented toward learning and attainment for all children; and the Education Policy Design Labs (EPDLs), to guide the identification of the most binding constraints to learning and the selection of interventions to tackle those binding constraints in a given country context. Moving forward, in 2020 SABER intends to continue supporting client countries in the deployment of these new initiatives at the country level to improve education system performance to achieve better outcomes, through the collection and validation of data, production and dissemination of web data, policy dialogue, country-based and regional capacity development, expansion of learning assessment coverage, and upstream support based on international good practices to inform the design of reforms, programs, or projects.

This poses an urban productivity puzzle because on-the-ground observations do not suggest that cities in developing countries function especially well or are conducive to enhanced productivity. This paper uses manufacturing censuses from four countries at differing levels of income that allow separating plant output quantity from prices. It shows that higher wage elasticities with respect to density are due to higher marginal costs, and agglomeration elasticities of efficiency, physical total factor productivity, are in fact far lower in developing countries. Further, congestion costs decrease with country income. Both are consistent with often low rates of structural transformation that make cities in developing countries so-called “sterile agglomerations,” which are populous but not efficient.', 'last_modified_date': '2022-03-21T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Industry,Social Protections and Labor'}\n",

World Development Report 2021: Data for Better Lives explores the tremendous potential of the changing data landscape to improve the lives of poor people, while also acknowledging its potential to open back doors that can harm individuals, businesses, and societies. To address this tension between the helpful and harmful potential of data, this report calls for a new social contract that enables the use and reuse of data to create economic and social value, ensures equitable access to that value, and fosters trust that data will not be misused in harmful ways. This report begins by assessing how better use and reuse of data can enhance the design of public policies, programs, and service delivery, as well as improve market efficiency and job creation through private sector growth. Because better data governance is key to realizing this value, the report then looks at how infrastructure policy, data regulation, economic policies, and institutional capabilities enable the sharing of data for their economic and social benefits, while safeguarding against harmful outcomes. The report concludes by pulling together the pieces and offering an aspirational vision of an integrated national data system that would deliver on the promise of producing high-quality data and making them accessible in a way that promotes their safe use and reuse.

The results suggest a significant decline in output of between 5 and 7 percent for March and April, respectively, while indicating a trough in output in mid-April.', 'last_modified_date': '2020-05-14T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Industry,Information and Communication Technologies,International Economics and Trade'}\n",

The method utilizes expenditure data from 2004-05, 2009–10, and 2011–12 to impute household expenditure into a survey of durable goods expenditure conducted in 2014- 15. At the 1.90 US dollar per day international poverty line, the preferred model predicts a 2014–15 head-count poverty rate of 10 percent in urban areas and 16.4 percent in rural areas, implying a poverty rate of 14.6 percent nationally. The implied poverty elasticity with respect to growth in per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is within the range of past experience, and stateswith higher gross domestic product growth saw greater predicted poverty reductions. In validation tests, the model’s predictions perform comparably to the World Bank’s current adjustment method when predicting for 2011–12 but they are far more accurate when predicting for 2004–05. Three alternative specifications give moderately higher estimates of poverty. The results indicate that survey-to-survey imputation, when feasible, is a preferable alternative to the current method used to adjust survey-based poverty estimates to later years.', 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Poverty Reduction,Transport,Public Sector Development,Governance,Agriculture,Social Protections and Labor'}\n",

The lack of robust, good quality data can also have a disabling effect on government efforts to manage political conflict, and indeed can worsen conflict, since violent settings pose substantial challenges to knowledge generation, capture and application. In short, in fragile contexts the need for reliable evidence at all levels is perhaps greater than anywhere else. The development of sustainable and professional ‘data-literate’ stakeholders who are able to produce and increase the quality and accessibility of official statistics can contribute to improved development outcomes. Good quality and reliable statistics are also required to track the progress of development policies through the monitoring of performance indicators and targets and to ensure that public resources are achieving results. While data alone cannot have a transformative effect without the right contextual incentives it is an essential and necessary prerequisite for greater accountability and more efficient decision-making. This volume explores methods and insights for data collection and use in fragile contexts, with a focus on Sudan. It begins by posing several questions on the political economy of data, and then sets out a framework for assessing the validity, reliability, and potential impact of data on decision-making in a fragile country. It also sets out insights on challenges associated with fragile states, derived from recent data collected in Sudan: the 2014/2015 DFID Sudan household survey.

Drawing on the experiences of recent decades, he sets out three necessary conditions for development: sustainable growth is necessary for a sustainable reduction in poverty, adjustment is necessary for the resumption of growth, and fiscal and monetary restraint is a necessary component of adjustment. However, these conditions may not be sufficient. The author discusses three areas in which experience has provided insights, but in which further work remains to be done. First, he points out that growth may not be sufficiency for poverty reduction; investment in human capital, notably in basic education and health, is an essential complement. Second, he considers the links between macroeconomic stability and microeconomic reforms such as privatization and financial sector reform. Additional research is required to understand the appropriate sequence for reforms and new regulatory needs. Finally, the author considers institutions and the transferability of policies. He concludes that the research agenda should aim at reducing the area of ignorance between what we know to be necessary and what we suspect to be sufficient, by deepening our knowledge of institutions and political factors and by drawing on the Bank's extensive operational knowledge.\", 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Poverty Reduction'}\n",

Forecasting relies on numerical weather prediction (NWP), which is significantly impacted by the availability of meteorological observations, with space-based observations being the most important. Surface-based observations also contribute substantially to NWP performance, but current availability in Antarctica, Africa, South America, the Pacific and parts of Asia is insufficient. More observations from these regions would improve global NWP and forecasting quality, particularly in the data-sparse regions themselves, but also over the rest of the globe. It is estimated that improvements in the coverage and exchange of surface-based observations to meet the World Meteorological Organization’s Global Basic Observing Network (GBON) specification can deliver additional global socioeconomic benefits of over five billion annually. This is a conservative estimate omitting non-financial benefits such as potential lives saved and improvements to well-being, so underestimates the full benefits, particularly for developing countries. Investing in improving surface-based observations in data sparse regions is also highly economically efficient, yielding a global benefit to cost ratio of over twenty-five. Assuming sufficient observational coverage, international data exchange is a very efficient multiplier of the value of observations. However, exchange is currently insufficient across all regions. In view of the growing climate- and weather-related challenges facing humanity and recognizing that climate services similarly rely on meteorological monitoring, surface-based observations should be treated as a critical public good, with public oversight and open exchange within the meteorological and climatological communities.', 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Water Resources,Social Development,Urban Development,Conflict and Development,Environment,Agriculture'}\n",

Modeling the lockdown-triggered revenue shock with simple and transparent assumptions, the analysis predicts that less than half of all firms will remain profitable by the end of 2020, about 5-10 percent of the formal aggregate annual payroll will be lost, and firm exit rates will double. As a result, it is expected that tax revenue remitted by the corporate sector will fall by at least 1.5 percent of baseline gross domestic product. Differences in sectoral composition and firms' cost structures generate heterogeneity in the results across countries: wage subsidies are less effective in low-income countries and government revenue losses are smaller.\", 'last_modified_date': '2020-10-14T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Rural Development,Industry,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Social Protections and Labor,International Economics and Trade'}\n",

These countries are therefore well advised to put in place backbone infrastructure building internet connectivity, cloud systems, and complementary support infrastructure such as suitable cyber-resilience systems. On this basis, the benefits of digital technologies across all sectors of development are in reach.

The eventual success was achieved through seamless cooperation of fiduciary, procurement, and operational teams, along with the PIU, and serves as a reminder for how important such smooth cooperation is for all procurements and overall project success. The project team reached out to some of the leading international experts, from countries that lead the e-Government agenda. Recommendations received were instrumental in defining the technical design and offering overall direction. The project profited from the fact that the project design was not too complicated from the outset, and from the fact that the project team did not alter the scope or level of ambition in light of the success that was progressively achieved.

The first is the need to inform the public about laws and decisions and the public's right to be informed, to know their rights and obligations. The second is the public's demand for the information needed to hold governments accountable both at and between elections. The third is the demand for information in order to participate actively in decision-making. The fourth is the provision to the public of information needed to access government services, which has expanded significantly in the past decade with growth of electronic access to services or 'e-government.' This paper attempts to advance the debate around that question by analyzing the multiple proactive disclosure provisions in national law and international treaties in order to identify the emerging global consensus on the classes of information which should be included in a proactive disclosure regime. The paper examines the practical challenges related to the implementation of proactive disclosure regimes and some of the lessons learned from which principles for making proactive disclosure work in practice can be derived.

This paper uses industry-level data in a sample of 45 developed and emerging countries and a differences-in-differences methodology to provide evidence of the role of financial frictions for the consequences of sudden stops. The results show that, consistently with financial frictions being important, industries that are more dependent on external finance decline significantly more during a sudden stop, especially in less financially developed countries. The results are robust to controlling for other possible mechanisms, including labor market frictions.

Forest-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, emission reductions, and enhanced removals (carbon sequestration) are estimated by measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV) systems, usually based on a combination of remote sensing data, field or in situ measurements, and modeling approaches. Under the UNFCCC, the lack of consistency limits the comparability between countries and makes the reconciliation of national reports and global estimates that are needed for the 2023 Global Stocktake under the Paris Agreements difficult. Moreover, the ongoing costs of MRV systems can be high, while the accuracy of the estimates is often low, and thus not able to unlock the full potential of climate finance.

The changes, described in this restructuring paper, seek to: i) modify the Project Development Objective (PDO) to reflect the name of the new Government agency which will approve the evaluation agenda in the future; ii) modify some of the activities outlined in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) for each of the project components: iii) modify the PDO and intermediate results indicators in the results framework matrix; iv) revise the project cost per component to reflect the current circumstances after almost three years of implementation; and v) revise the funding allocations of the loan agreement. The request entails a Level one restructuring due to the slight modification of the PDO. The implementation schedule will remain the same. A level two restructuring was approved by the World Bank on September 9, 2010 in response to the Government's request to revise the funding allocations need for a significant number of training events, dissemination activities, and editing and publication of materials. In addition, the definition of 'training' was revised in section four, Part of the loan agreement. The changes are to provide more flexibility in use of project funds in order to avoid future amendments to the loan agreement and to reflect new government priorities by incorporating new activities related to open data and 'Sinergia Territoral' and removing activities no longer critical to the achievement of the PDO.

In order to preserve the integrity of the goalposts for international targets such as the Sustainable Development Goals and the World Bank’s twin goals, the new poverty line was chosen so as to preserve the definition and real purchasing power of the earlier $1.25 line (in 2005 PPPs) in poor countries. Using the new 2011 PPPs, the new line equals $1.90 per person per day. The higher value of the line in US dollars reflects the fact that the new PPPs yield a relatively lower purchasing power of that currency vis-à-vis those of most poor countries. Because the line was designed to preserve real purchasing power in poor countries, the revisions lead to relatively small changes in global poverty incidence: from 14.5 percent in the old method to 14.1 percent in the new method for 2011. In 2012, the new reference year for the global count, we find 12.7 percent of the world’s population, or 897 million people, are living in extreme poverty.

The end product of this growth is floor space, the amount and distribution of which are central to understanding how a city becomes livable and sustainable. Over the quarter century between 1990 and 2015, urban built-up area worldwide grew by 30 percent through horizontal spread and infill. While most cities grow through a combination of horizontal spread and infill, the paper provides the first estimates of the relative prominence of each type of expansion at different stages of economic development. In low-income and lower-middle-income countries, 90 percent of urban built-up area expansion occurs as horizontal spread. The study also finds that increasing incomes are a uniquely necessary condition for a rise in floor space per person through vertical layering: the reason is that building tall is capital intensive. The analysis highlights that if a city’s population doubles but incomes stay constant, the city’s floor space per person declines by 40 percent; by contrast, if per capita income doubles but population stays constant, the city’s total floor space per person increases by 29 percent.', 'last_modified_date': '2021-04-09T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Social Development,Communities and Human Settlements,Conflict and Development,Public Sector Development,Urban Development,Transport'}\n",

And once households respond to the mobile phone interviews, they tend not to drop out: even after 33 rounds of interviews in the Tanzania survey, respondent fatigue proved not to be an issue.

Hence, this technical note aims to argue that opening up relevant data in open and standardized formats can lead to better decisions regarding land use planning while reducing the cost and complexity of the entire process. This note has been primarily written for the Self-Governing Region of Košice (KSK) in the Slovak Republic in preparing its next land use plan and is considering how to improve the procurement process. The broader objective of the note is to provide practical examples and recommendations on land use planning and data management that could be considered by any Self- Governing Region in the Slovak Republic or any other local or national government. The note concludes with suggestions for improving land use planning at the regional level through better data management.

Using a new nationally-representative panel dataset of schools across 1297 villages in India, the authors show that the large public investments in education over the past decade have led to substantial improvements in input-based measures of school quality, but only a modest reduction in inefficiency as measured by teacher absence. In our data, 23.6 percent of teachers were absent during unannounced school visits, and the authors estimate that the salary cost of unauthorized teacher absence is 1.5 billion per year. The authors find two robust correlations in the nationally-representative panel data that corroborate findings from smaller-scale experiments. First, reductions in student-teacher ratios are correlated with increased teacher absence. Second, increases in the frequency of school monitoring are strongly correlated with lower teacher absence. Using these results, the authors show that reducing inefficiencies by increasing the frequency of monitoring could be over ten times more cost effective at increasing the effective student-teacher ratio than hiring more teachers. Thus, policies that decrease the inefficiency of public education spending are likely to yield substantially higher marginal returns than those that augment inputs.', 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Water Supply and Sanitation,Education,Energy,Water Resources'}\n",
            "{'id': '31345697', 'abstract': 'This paper investigates the sources of growth in manufacturing productivity in Cote D’Ivoire, Ethiopia and Tanzania in comparison with the case of Bangladesh. Based on the analysis of establishment census data since the mid-1990s, it finds that reallocation of market share between firms contributed substantially to productivity growth in each of the four countries, although to a varying extent. In Ethiopia, the impact of market share reallocations among survivors tended to be larger than those associated with increases in within-plant productivity. In addition, plant closure (or exit) boosted productivity more than new plant openings (or entry) did in the sense that the relative productivity of survivors (or continuing plants) was higher relative to that of closing plants (or exit cases) than it was relative to the productivity of newly opening plants (or new entrants). Reallocation of market share plays an important role in raising aggregate productivity in Côte d’Ivoire as well. But the pattern here is opposite to that in Ethiopia in that in Côte d’Ivoire entering (or newly opening) plants have larger impact on aggregate productivity growth than closing (or exiting) plants. Unlike the case with Cote D’Ivoire and of Ethiopia, the reallocation of market share among surviving plants is a smaller source of manufacturing productivity growth in Tanzania than the new plant openings and plant closure. The data suggest that the reallocation of market share among surviving plants and exiting plants has larger impact on productivity growth in Bangladesh than the productivity gap between new plants and survivors, as in the case of Ethiopia.', 'last_modified_date': '2019-08-19T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Industry,Social Protections and Labor,International Economics and Trade,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Transport'}\n",

This study seeks to address this question and further investigates whether socioemotional skill signals in job applicants' resumes have the same value for male and female candidates. In a large-scale randomized audit study, an online job portal in Turkey is used to send fictitious resumes to real job openings, collecting a unique data set that enables investigating different stages of candidate screening. The study finds that socioemotional skills appear to be valued only when an employer specifically asks for such skills in the vacancy ad. When not asked for, however, candidates can face a penalty in the form of lower callback rates. A significant penalty is only observed for women, not for men. The study does not find evidence of other gender differences in the hiring process.\", 'last_modified_date': '2020-02-18T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Gender,Social Protections and Labor,Rural Development,Law and Development'}\n",

A potential breakthrough to help in this challenge is the emerging field of ‘Spatial Finance’, the independent assessment of the location of a company’s or a country’s assets and infrastructure using ground data, remote sensing observations and modelled insights, offers a potentially transformative means to gain improved quantitative ESG insights. Rapid development is required if spatial finance is to deliver in the short term. In this report, authors outline a possible taxonomy and hierarchy for spatial finance, showing how discrete forms of technology, approaches and data can be considered within a single consistent framework. Using this framework, spatial finance could provide insights at differing scales for different applications from the asset-scale for project finance, to company-scale for investment, to country scale for sovereign debt.

            "{'id': '30803488', 'abstract': \"The paper provides the first consistently estimated data set on infrastructure investments in low- and middle-income countries. To do so, the authors identify three possible proxies for infrastructure investments: two are variants on gross fixed capital formation from national accounts system data following ADB (2017) and one is based on fiscal data from the World Bank's BOOST database. Two of these proxies rely on the World Bank's Private Participation in Infrastructure database to capture the private share of infrastructure investments. Given the limitations of each of these proxies, the authors employ several transformations to derive a lower-bound estimate for infrastructure investments in low-and middle-income countries of 3.40 percent of their gross domestic product, a central estimate of around 4 percent, and an upper-bound estimate of 5 percent for 2011. Corresponding absolute amounts are US$0.82 trillion, US$1.00 trillion, and US$1.21 trillion, respectively with East Asia and the Pacific accounting for 55 percent of infrastructure investments and Africa 4 percent. The public sector largely dominates infrastructure spending, accounting for 87–91 percent of infrastructure investments, but with wide variation across regions, from a low of 53–64 percent in South Asia to a high of 98 percent in East Asia. Given the absence of fiscal or national accounts data capturing investments in infrastructure, these estimates are likely to be the best available in the near future. Nevertheless, the authors propose some possible avenues for future improvements (including an update when 2017 data are made available by the International Comparison Project), building on the excellent collaboration of multilateral development banks around this issue.\", 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Governance,Industry,Science and Technology Development,Public Sector Development,Transport,Water Resources'}\n",

Some lessons learned included: monitoring and evaluation (M&E) frameworks should be well developed at the time of project effectiveness. Several aspects of the HSRP M&E framework lacked a clear link to project activities, and it was made in the absence of good baseline data. Surveys undertaken during project effectiveness were not consistent, making it difficult to compare data over time. A simple insistence on using the same core questionnaire in each survey from start to finish will be a big step forward. Although Bank-financed projects can not always be coordinated with election cycles, starting an ambitious health reform project less than one year before an election is fraught with risk. To the extent possible, reform projects should be mindful of electoral considerations. There are valuable synergies between investment operations and Development Policy Loans (DPLs) that should be exploited wherever feasible. Investment projects can open policy dialogue and build trust as a precursor to policy-based lending, as well as finance Technical Assistance (TA) that can inform DPL activities once they are operational.

Thus pathways out of poverty are likely to be strongly connected to productivity increases in the rural economy, whether they are realized in farming, in rural nonfarm enterprises, or by way of rural-urban migration. The authors use cross-sectional data from the Central Statistical Board for 1993 and 2002, as well as a panel data set from the Indonesia Family Life Survey for 1993 and 2000, to show which pathways out of poverty were most successful over this period. The findings suggest that increased engagement of farmers in rural nonfarm enterprises is an important route out of rural poverty, but that most of the rural agricultural poor that exit poverty still do so while remaining rural and agricultural. So changes in agricultural prices, wages, and productivity still play a critical role in moving people out of poverty.', 'last_modified_date': '2007-03-20T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Health, Nutrition and Population,Poverty Reduction'}\n",

Sub-Saharan African countries are mostly still relatively closed, and one of their top priorities should be to open up. With some important, identifiable, exceptions African exports are not disproportionately restricted in OECD markets. Because of Sub-Saharan Africa\\'s small economic size and because its decline in competitiveness has been spread over nearly all sectors, improvements in its performance should not unduly disturb other members of the world economy and should not encounter major resistance among trading partners. Sub-Saharan African countries won fewer concessions on their exports in the Uruguay Round than did other developing countries -possibly because they offered fewer concessions on imports. Nonetheless, because they started the Round with more favorable treatment, they still emerged from it facing fewer or lower restrictions than other developing countries. In the next Round of trade negotiations, Sub-Saharan countries have some \"rights\" to negotiate (according to the GATT/WTO \"principal suppliers\" traditions) and a little leverage. They should be active in this Round, both giving and requesting concessions, and economists should help them prepare the ground. Trade preferences are not the route to integrating with the world economy. In terms of access to partners\\' markets, trade preferences are no substitute for bound most-favored-nation tariff reductions, and they also encourage shortsighted and distortionary behavior within the recipients\\' economy.

Macroeconomic regression models are commonly used for medium- and long-term forecasts and policy prescriptions even though the time series data they use is of uncertain or low reliability. As the time series are very short, and since most of their variables seem to decay over the short periods for which data can be assembled, every attempt to include in the equations all the relevant independent variables soon exhausts the degrees of freedom and produces collinearities.

First, it is an improvement in terms of accuracy because projections are based on revenues actually collected at the tariff line level rather than simply applying statutory rates. Second, it is transparent and open; runs in Excel, with formulas and calculation steps visible to the user; and is open-source and users are free to change, extend, or improve according to their needs. Third, TRIST has greater policy relevance because it projects the impact of tariff reform on total fiscal revenue (including VAT and excise) and results are broken down to the product level so that sensitive products or sectors can be identified. And fourth, the tool is flexible and can incorporate tariff liberalization scenarios involving any group of trading partners and any schedules of products. This paper describes the TRIST tool and provides a range of examples that demonstrate the insights that the tool can provide to policy makers on the adjustment impacts of reducing tariffs.', 'last_modified_date': '2009-10-19T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,International Economics and Trade,Finance and Financial Sector Development'}\n",

Economic advantages from best practice based on the use of electronic commerce in trade management and trade facilitation are described and several case studies referenced. The case studies cover national, industry and enterprise level experiences from several countries. An analysis of information and cargo flows in international trade accompanies a discussion of the efficiency of transport and logistics and the concept of IT based best practice, with particular emphasis on electronic commerce and Electronic Data Interchange (EDI). The opportunities for these technologies to open up world trade are considered, as are the technologies and services themselves. Barriers to use and participation are discussed and means by which these may be overcome. The task, time scales and costs involved in setting up and implementing a national initiative are identified, as are the potential revenue streams which accompany service provision, and the national benefits of such a program. A selection of national case studies is prefaced by a global review of participation in IT assisted trade facilitation and best practice. National case studies from Brazil, Hong Kong, Hungary, Singapore and Taiwan are followed by a status report of the World Bank's experience in this area, with particular reference to the Mauritius model. The summary contains a discussion of the main challenges and dangers resulting from technological disenfranchisement, followed by a comprehensive list of participating agencies and organizations.\", 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Transport'}\n",

Both studies treat the world’s marine fisheries as one large fishery, and they both model the economic performance of the sector in terms of this single aggregate fishery. This study, however, departs from the original one by deepening the regional analysis. In addition, this study examines the range of complex issues that surround the reform of global fisheries management, including the financial and social costs of transitioning to a more sustainable resource management path, the considerable governance challenges associated with managing the largely open-access ocean resources, and the complicating factor of climate change. Although it does not attempt to address all of these issues fully, it lays out a comprehensive estimate of what the economic benefits of transitioning to higher value-added and more sustainable fisheries might look like. The primary objective of this study is to reinforce the messages of the 2009 publication and to catalyze calls for accelerating and scaling up the international effort aimed at addressing the global fisheries crisis. The analysis reveals economic losses of about $83 billion in 2012, compared with the optimal global maximum economic yield equilibrium. This result is not statistically different from the sunken billions estimated for 2004, which was adjusted to $88 billion, based on improvements in the model, better data, and adjustment to 2012 dollars. Both figures are strikingly large, and they highlight the fact that the fisheries sector is being managed in a deeply unsustainable manner.', 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Water Resources,Industry'}\n",

Using monthly data from the socio-economic surveys of 2007-2010, this paper finds, after controlling for household variables, that real consumption per capita rose in 2009 relative to 2008 for most groups, including the poor, urban and rural households, men, women, and children. The losers were residents of Bangkok, especially those aged 20-29, and those working in sales and services. During the recession year of 2009, school enrollment rates did not fall, and durable goods purchases actually rose; households probably reduced their savings, and also benefitted from the lower food prices that prevailed in 2009. A simulation exercise based on the slowdown in growth of gross domestic product would have missed these effects, as would models based solely on readily-available data series.

The analyses show: (i) crop cultivation, livestock management, forestry and fishing activities, and agricultural wages remain important income sources in rural Vietnam—especially for poorer households; (ii) rural communes are exposed to substantial inter- and intra-annual weather variation, as measured by annual, seasonal, abnormal, and extreme weather conditions and weather events; and (iii) these types of weather variation are indeed related to income variation. In particular, warmer temperatures and heat extremes can have negative income effects in all climate contexts and for all socioeconomic groups and most income activities. Only staple crops, forestry, and fishing seem to be less sensitive to hotter conditions. The effects of rainfall are more difficult to generalize. Some findings indicate that more rainfall is beneficial in drier places but harmful in wetter places. Interestingly, the incomes of poorer households seem to be negatively affected by wetter conditions, while those of wealthier households are more impacted by drier conditions. An increase in rainfall levels and flood conditions between 2012 and 2014, which were relatively wet years, is related to reduced income growth between these two years. Altogether these findings suggests that greater attention has to be paid to making rural livelihoods more resilient to weather variation which, is very likely to increase because of climate change.', 'last_modified_date': '2016-07-25T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Poverty Reduction,Science and Technology Development,Rural Development,Environment,Health, Nutrition and Population,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth'}\n",

Aside from economic size (already shown to affect the currency composition), this paper shows that investor bases matter. Economies with deeper domestic financial systems (measured by bank deposits and stock market capitalization) have larger domestic currency bond markets and issue less foreign currency debt, whereas foreign investor demand is positively related to the size and share of foreign currency bonds. Moreover, less flexible exchange rate regimes are associated with more foreign currency issuance.

It is a unique study exploring the performance motivation of the public sector CHW on one of the largest CHW programmes in the world. The evidence on CHWs’ performance motivation and that of public sector CHW programmes are limited. The unique application of the mixed-methods approach will enhance the generalisability of the study findings. It helped in finding the causality between thelevel of CHW’s motivation and its each determinant along with an understanding of how and why a CHW is motivated or demotivated. The study discussions are centred on comparable global experiences for relevant policy changes. The CHW programme could motivate and empower local lay women on community health largely. The desire to gain social recognition, a sense of socialresponsibility and self-efficacy motivated them to perform. The healthcare delivery system improvements might further motivate and enable them to gain the community trust. The CHW management needs amendments to ensure adequate supportive supervision, skill and knowledge enhancement and enabling working modalities.', 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Health, Nutrition and Population,Communities and Human Settlements,Education'}\n",

This paper proposes a non-parametric adaptation of a recently developed parametric technique to produce point estimates of intra-generational economic mobility in the absence of panel data sets that follow individuals over time. The method predicts past individual income or consumption using time-invariant observable characteristics, which allows the estimation of mobility into and out of poverty, as well as household-level income or consumption growth, from cross-sectional data. The paper validates this method by sampling repeated cross-sections out of actual panel data sets from three countries in the Latin America region and comparing the technique with mobility from panels. Overall, the method performs well in the three settings; with few exceptions, all estimates fall within the 95 percent confidence intervals of the panel mobility. The quality of the estimates does not depend in general on the sophistication level of the underlying welfare model's specifications.

The authors find that higher Internet penetration in developing countries is correlated with greater exports to industrial countries, but not with trade between developing countries or with exports from industrial countries. Interpreting the correlations is difficult because causation may run from Internet use to exports or from trade openness to Internet use. To test whether Internet use affects export behavior, the authors endogenize Internet use by using countries' regulation of data services and Internet provision as instrumental variables. The results are robust to endogenizing Internet penetration, suggesting that access to the Internet does affect the export performance of firms in developing countries. In other words, Internet access appears to stimulate exports from poor countries to rich countries.

As globalized world continues to be gripped by an economic downturn, few countries are spared from having to wrestle with the consequences for their people of unanticipated economic shocks and unmet expectations for good jobs. After extensive consultation and dialogue with clients, stakeholders and practitioners about needs in this fast-changing world, we have designed the strategy with a core focus: to move SPL from isolated interventions to a coherent connected portfolio of programs. This systemic approach helps countries to address the fragmentation and duplication across programs, and to create financing, governance and solutions tailored to their own contexts. A focus on systems is not an end in itself. It is a gateway to deliver outcomes. Effective SPL systems build resilience by ensuring that individuals and families are well-protected against the sudden shocks that are likely to overwhelm them. They improve equity at both national and global levels by reducing poverty and destitution with strong support to people in low income countries, and those in the informal sector. And they promote opportunity to improve people's productivity and incomes, through preserving and building their human capital, and through access to better jobs and income which can propel them out of poverty. The strategy is designed to help harness knowledge management in key ways: by generating evidence and lessons to inform effective policies; promoting South-South knowledge sharing and open access to data and information; and providing global leadership in research, analysis and data management. Today, SPL at the World Bank is a young, strong sector, accounting for a significant share of Bank lending and knowledge and serving as a global leader in its work on evidence-based policy-making.

This enhancement is accompanied by an expanded sector coverage including, inter alia, tourism and healthcare services, which are of particular interest to many African economies. The collection, processing and vetting of regulatory data took place during 2020-22 and was supported by the German Development Agency GIZ, the European Commission and the International Trade Centre (ITC), respectively, as part of their support for the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) negotiations. This paper presents evidence on the 2020-2021 state of applied services trade policy across 54 African economies. It offers detailed comparisons of policy stances across economies, broad sectors, subsectors, and modes of supply. Services trade policies in Africa are generally relatively restrictive, albeit with substantial dispersion across economies within each sector. Professional services are the most restricted, while computer and distribution services appear as the least restricted sectors. Larger economies in terms of market size tend to be more restrictive towards services trade whereas economies with better institutions, including higher regulatory quality, tend to be more open. At the same time, relatively high levels of restrictiveness in transportation amongst more industrialized economies may curtail connectivity and thus hamper African economies’ international integration prospects. Landlocked economies also seem to miss an opportunity to alleviate pre-existing geographical disadvantages with more open transportation service policies. Overall, the wealth of quantitative information on policy restrictiveness presented in this paper, along with the underpinning regulatory information, provides a factual basis for the advancement of policy reform, regional integration, and cooperation in services sectors.', 'last_modified_date': '2023-06-22T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'N/A'}\n",

When the KGFS branch opened in Alakudi in September 2008, staff visited every household to conduct a village and household mapping exercise to demarcate the service area for the branch. They also invited villagers to come to the branch to enroll. As part of enrollment, staff completed a comprehensive know your customer (KYC) check, including a household visit, and compiled a household financial well-being report based on data provided by each household.

Using data from 164 countries comprising 97 percent of the world’s population, this paper simulates a set of scenarios for global poverty from 2018 to 2030 under different assumptions about growth and inequality. This allows for quantifying the interdependence of the poverty and inequality goals. The paper uses different assumptions about growth incidence curves to model changes in inequality and relies on the model based recursive partitioning machine-learning algorithm to model how growth in GDP is passed through to growth as observed in household surveys. When holding within-country inequality unchanged and letting GDP per capita grow according to International Monetary Fund forecasts, the simulations suggest that the number of extreme poor (living below $1.90 a day) will remain above 550 million in 2030, resulting in a global extreme poverty rate of 6.5 percent. If the Gini index in each country decreases by 1 percent per year, the global poverty rate will reduce to around 5.4 percent in 2030, equivalent to 100 million fewer people living in extreme poverty. Reducing each country’s Gini index by 1 percent per year has a larger impact on global poverty than increasing each country’s annual growth 1 percentage point above the forecasts, suggesting an important role for inequality on the path to eliminating extreme poverty.', 'last_modified_date': '2019-06-03T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Industry,International Economics and Trade,Poverty Reduction'}\n",

As globalized world continues to be gripped by an economic downturn, few countries are spared from having to wrestle with the consequences for their people of unanticipated economic shocks and unmet expectations for good jobs. After extensive consultation and dialogue with clients, stakeholders and practitioners about needs in this fast-changing world, we have designed the strategy with a core focus: to move SPL from isolated interventions to a coherent connected portfolio of programs. This systemic approach helps countries to address the fragmentation and duplication across programs, and to create financing, governance and solutions tailored to their own contexts. A focus on systems is not an end in itself. It is a gateway to deliver outcomes. Effective SPL systems build resilience by ensuring that individuals and families are well-protected against the sudden shocks that are likely to overwhelm them. They improve equity at both national and global levels by reducing poverty and destitution with strong support to people in low income countries, and those in the informal sector. And they promote opportunity to improve people's productivity and incomes, through preserving and building their human capital, and through access to better jobs and income which can propel them out of poverty. The strategy is designed to help harness knowledge management in key ways: by generating evidence and lessons to inform effective policies; promoting South-South knowledge sharing and open access to data and information; and providing global leadership in research, analysis and data management. Today, SPL at the World Bank is a young, strong sector, accounting for a significant share of Bank lending and knowledge and serving as a global leader in its work on evidence-based policy-making. The strategy builds on the foundation of this work.

In 1999, India launched the Total Sanitation Campaign with the goal of achieving universal toilet coverage in rural India by 2012. This paper reports on a cluster-randomized, controlled trial that was conducted in 80 rural villages in Madhya Pradesh to measure the effect of the program on toilet access, sanitation behavior, and child health outcomes. The study analyzed a random sample of 3,039 households and 5,206 children under five years of age. Field staff collected baseline measures of sanitation conditions, behavior, and child health, and re-visited households 21 months later. The analysis finds that implementation of the program activities was slower than the original timeline (only 35 percent of villages were triggered more than six months before the follow-up survey). Nevertheless, the Total Sanitation Campaign successfully increased toilet coverage by 19 percent in intervention villages compared with control villages (41 percent v. 22 percent), while reported open defecation decreased by 10 percent among adults (74 percent v. 84 percent). The intervention also led to some improvements in water quality and protozoan infection, but consistent improvements were not observed across multiple child health outcomes (diarrhea, helminth infections, child growth). However, the exposure period was likely to have been too short to result in any benefit of the sanitation interventions on child health. Given the large improvements in toilet construction documented, an additional follow-up survey with a longer period of exposure would yield valuable information on the effects of improved sanitation conditions on health outcomes.', 'last_modified_date': '2013-11-14T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Water Supply and Sanitation,Health, Nutrition and Population,Communities and Human Settlements'}\n",

Fees structures are complex and extensive prompting the need for user-friendly price comparison tools to improve transparency and competition. Allowing non-banks fair access to critical financial infrastructure, which is currently owned by banks and incumbents, should be pursued by policies and regulations to promote competition. To achieve a balance between competition and stability, the Prudential Authority and National Treasury should consider adopting proportionate regulatory frameworks aligned with the business risk profile of new entrants. Competition and efficiency of the South African financial sector could be enhanced through market friendly policies that preserve financial stability, fostering the entrance of new players that cater to specific market segments and exploiting differences in investors' risk appetite. The authorities should leverage ongoing legal reforms to develop a regulatory framework for open banking and improve accessibility of government data. Fixed income markets play a limited role as a source of long-term financing and liquidity to the private corporate sector, despite being sizable and relatively well developed.

Using monthly data, they provide econometric estimates of the determinants of inflation for 1990-92. Empirical estimates of price equations - both consumer price index (CPI) and producer price index (PPI) - show the exchange rate's quantitative importance and statistical significance in price formation in Hungary during the period of intensified reform as the economy became more open to international trade in both inputs and final goods. Their estimates show that the money supply affects consumer and producer prices with several lags; its impact on prices is small in the short run. Nominal wages have a more significant effect on the CPI than on the PPI. The authors present policy simulations of alternative rules for the exchange rate and the money supply and their effect on the rate of inflation and the level of the real exchange rate. They find that a rule of fixing the exchange rate entails a lower level of CPI inflation - 5 percentage points less of CPI inflation a year - than if the rule is based only on reducing the rate of money growth (to 1 percent a month). But a fixed exchange rate policy is associated with greater appreciation of the real exchange rate than is the policy of money-based disinflation - nearly 4 percentage points more real appreciation a year. A PPI-based exchange rate rule stabilizes the real exchange rate at the cost of a substantial acceleration in inflation. These exercises illustate the nature and magnitude of the tradeoffs between faster disinflation and the level of external competitiveness in an open economy such as Hungary that uses the exchange rate as a nominal anchor in disinflation.\", 'last_modified_date': '2001-04-19T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Environment'}\n",

This enhancement is accompanied by expanded sector coverage including, inter alia, tourism and health care services, which are of particular interest to many African economies. The collection, processing, and vetting of regulatory data took place during 2020–22 and was supported by the German Development Agency GIZ, the European Commission and the International Trade Centre, respectively, as part of their support for the African Continental Free Trade Area negotiations. This paper presents evidence on the 2020/21 state of applied services trade policy across 54 African economies. It offers detailed comparisons of policy stances across economies, broad sectors, subsectors, and modes of supply. Services trade policies in Africa are generally relatively restrictive, albeit with substantial dispersion across economies within each sector. Professional services are the most restricted, while computer and distribution services appear as the least restricted sectors. Larger economies in terms of market size tend to be more restrictive toward services trade, whereas economies with better institutions, including higher regulatory quality, tend to be more open. At the same time, relatively high levels of restrictiveness in transportation among the more industrialized economies may curtail connectivity and thus hamper African economies’ international integration prospects. Landlocked economies also seem to miss an opportunity to alleviate pre-existing geographical disadvantages with more open transportation service policies. Overall, the wealth of quantitative information on policy restrictiveness presented in this paper, along with the underpinning regulatory information, provides a factual basis for the advancement of policy reform, regional integration, and cooperation in service sectors.', 'last_modified_date': '2023-08-07T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'N/A'}\n",

Recognizing the importance of a differentiated approach to entrepreneurship in terms of legal entities, the data on female and male business owners are collected at the level of limited liability companies and sole proprietorships. Forty-four of the 143 economies that participated in the Entrepreneurship project provided some sex-disaggregated data for 2016. The paper finds that the gender gap in business ownership remains high in many economies around the world. In the majority of the analyzed economies, less than one-third of new limited liability company owners are women. Although sole proprietorships are more frequently used by female entrepreneurs, only three economies have similar or equal number of women business owners relative to men. The gap in female entrepreneurship is especially apparent in low-income economies, where women are much less likely than men to start a new business. The paper also provides new insights into the relationship between female entrepreneurship and various institutional factors, including women's financial inclusion, the gender gap in education, and legal rights disparities. The analysis suggests a need to expand the collection of sex-disaggregated data, to trace the economies' progress in narrowing the existing gender gap in entrepreneurship.\", 'last_modified_date': '2018-03-18T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Science and Technology Development,Gender,Industry,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth'}\n",

A cursory review of employment data for low-income Sub-Saharan African countries shows both large gaps and improbable variation within countries over time and among countries, suggesting that low quality data are routinely reported by national statistics offices. Unfortunately, policies are formed and projects developed and implemented on the basis of these statistics. Therefore, errors of measurement could be having profound implications on the strategic priorities and policies of a country. This paper explains the improbable results observed by using data from Uganda, where the labor module contains variation both within and across surveys, to show the sensitivity of employment outcomes to survey methodology. It finds that estimates of employment outcomes are unreliable if the questionnaire did not use screening questions, as labor force participation will be underestimated. Likewise, surveys that use a seven-day recall period underestimate or potentially misrepresent employment outcomes, owing to seasonality and multiple jobs. Common multivariate analysis applied on household survey data will be affected, as the errors in measurement in the dependent and independent variables will be correlated. Corrections to reduce measurement bias in existing data are tested with the survey data; none are found to be completely satisfactory.

Focusing on the Uganda data, OLS regressions reveal a positive and signiﬁcant correlation between refugee-host interaction and the perception of hosts towards refugees. This association disappears when an instrumental variable (IV) approach is used to address endogeneity issues, except when only data from the urban context is used. The analysis of cross-country data highlights further diﬀerences in the types of interaction and perception that matter between urban and camp-like contexts. It also suggests that ethno-linguistic proximity between refugee and host populations is associated with more positive attitudes.

Part II gives detailed flow charts of the functional processes associated with Treasury systems, a diagnostic questionnaire that could be used to assess country specific requirements, a set of sample functional specification software that would be required to implement these systems, and a listing of the main data associated with Treasury systems. TRM also provides a means for implementing improved analytical standards for fiscal reporting. Increasingly governments are moving toward accrual basis reports and the IMF Government Finance Statistics system is being revised accordingly.', 'last_modified_date': '2018-03-19T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Governance,Public Sector Development'}\n",

Using firm-level data from the Czech Republic for the period 1998-2003, this study examines the link between services sector reforms and the productivity of domestic firms in downstream manufacturing. Several aspects of services reform are considered and measured, namely, the increased presence of foreign providers, privatization, and enhanced competition. The manufacturing-services linkage is measured using information on the degree to which manufacturing firms in a particular industry rely on intermediate inputs from specific services sectors. The econometric results lead to two conclusions. First, the study finds that services policy matters for the productivity of manufacturing firms relying on services inputs. This finding is robust to several econometric specifications, including controlling for unobservable firm heterogeneity and for other aspects of openness. Second, it finds evidence that opening services sectors to foreign providers is a key channel through which services liberalization contributes to improved performance of downstream manufacturing sectors. This finding is robust to instrumenting for the extent of foreign presence in services industries. As most barriers to foreign investment today are not in goods but in services sectors, the findings may strengthen the argument for reform in this area.', 'last_modified_date': '2007-01-09T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Finance and Financial Sector Development,Education'}\n",

Without a good investment climate, firms and entrepreneurs of all types-from farmers to micro-enterprises to local manufacturing concerns and multinationals-have few opportunities and incentives to invest productively, create jobs, and expand, enter and remain in the formal economy, and thereby contribute to growth and poverty reduction. Growth and private sector development encompass a very broad agenda, but in Poland's case such a challenge boils down to the objective of reducing the convergence time to the standard of living of the European Union (EU)-15 countries. Sound macroeconomic policy, debt sustainability, open trade, security, access to finance, good governance and quality infrastructure services are all key requirements for the private sector to flourish. These conditions need to be complemented by micro-economic reforms-the policies and institutions that support efficient private economic activity-that help to unleash competitive forces leading to increased productivity and competitiveness. The Poland Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) is the first ICA piloted in the World Bank's Europe and Central region in 2004, adding to the stock of knowledge from the many other country reports prepared worldwide. The Poland ICA provides benchmark data to assess firm-level performance in other countries in the Europe and Central Asia region.

Exogenous increases do not seem to cause increases in the rate of technological change, but instead seem to be associated with lower rates of return to capital. Increased openness to international trade speeds up growth and technological change as do an increase in scientists and engineers. Countries more open to trade have a higher level of investment and capital growth - which is not associated with a fall in the marginal product of capital. Countries that become more integrated with world markets seem to have a higher marginal product of capital. Increases in capital investment associated with a higher per capita GDP are associated with a fall in the marginal product of capital. Increases in capital investment associated with increases in trade are not. This suggests that policies to encourage more open trading may be as important to growth as additional foreign lending - especially in their cumulative effects - and at the same time enhance the efficient use of foreign loans.', 'last_modified_date': '2017-03-07T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Environment,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Finance and Financial Sector Development,Poverty Reduction'}\n",

The five studies, Bolivia, Burkina Faso, Cambodia, Tanzania and Vietnam aim to assess the extent to which public finance management and budget allocations reflect the principles and content of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper PRSP, hence providing insights into progress in PRS implementation. The cases also shed light on whether the PRSP process itself has fostered more accountable, efficient and pro-poor budget processes and allocations as of 2003.The PRSP process, with its focus on data and information for evidence-based policy-making, open and participatory policy-making processes, poverty results and country-led donor coordination, alignment and harmonization has the potential to significantly improve the pro-poor focus and general accountability of budgeting processes.The cases confront a number of methodological challenges. First, in some countries and sectors, lack of appropriate data constrained the extent to which the research questions could be fully answered. Second, the PRSP remains a relatively recent innovation in all the countries studied and we recognize that many of our findings are preliminary, and require additional confirmation over time. Third, any assessment of the value added of the PRSP approach needs to be cognizant of the initial conditions in country, both to avoid ascribing successes to the PRSP which pre-date its existence, and to temper expectations about what the approach can deliver in a relatively short space of time given the starting point of each country. To address this last challenge, the case studies explicitly acknowledge the pre-existing situation in-country and try to assess the value added of the PRSP process.The four countries studied have a number of common features.Finally, and perhaps most importantly, all five countries share a high-level political commitment to addressing poverty, although the extent to which this commitment permeates throughout government agencies varies from country to country.The five countries, however, also display many distinctive features.

We believe a better link from standardized diagnosis to recommendations is needed, while recognizing that a single formulaic framework is not desirable. In general, Jobs Diagnostics guidelines should help contribute to thinking about causes of jobs problems identified in data tests, with priorities for policies and operations should be based on evidence and not be left too open to discretion. This is a first attempt to help practitioners narrow down Jobs problems, think deeply about their causes, and prioritize between possible solution areas. Thus, the examples given in this paper are not exhaustive, and its recommendations are not meant to be prescriptive. The guidance will be refined in the coming years, as more practical examples emerge and we gain further lessons in strategic prioritization.', 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Social Protections and Labor,Rural Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Industry,Agriculture'}\n",

In this approach, the parameters in a computable general equilibrium model are treated as fixed but unobserved, represented as prior mean values with prior error mass functions.

Using unique data from nationally representative surveys of schools in seven Sub-Saharan African countries, this paper proposes a methodology to assess the effect of teacher subject content knowledge on student learning when panel data on students are not available. The paper shows that data on test scores of the student's current and the previous year's teachers, and knowledge of the correlation structure of teacher knowledge across time and grades, allow estimating two structural parameters of interest: the contemporaneous effect of teacher content knowledge, and the extent of fade out of teacher impacts in earlier grades. The paper uses these structural estimates to understand the magnitude of teacher effects and simulate the impacts of various policy reforms. Shortfalls in teachers' content knowledge account for 30 percent of the shortfall in learning relative to the curriculum, and about 20 percent of the cross-country difference in learning in the sample. Assigning more students to better teachers would potentially lead to substantial cost-savings, even if there are negative class-size effects. Ensuring that all incoming teachers have the officially mandated effective years of education, along with increasing the time spent on teaching to the officially mandated schedule, could almost double student learning within the next 30 years.\", 'last_modified_date': '2019-05-07T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Education'}\n",

However, economists have had difficulty applying the New Keynesian Phillips Curve to real-world data due to empirical limitations. This paper overcomes these limitations by using an identification-robust estimation method called the Tikhonov Jackknife instrumental variables estimator. Data from Morocco are used to examine the ability of the New Keynesian Phillips Curve to explain Moroccan inflation dynamics. The analysis finds that by adding more information to the hybrid version of the New Keynesian Phillips Curve model by increasing the number of moment conditions, the inflation dynamics in Morocco can be well-described by the New Keynesian Phillips Curve.

Yet, the accounting of water supply and sanitation subsidies globally has proved challenging due to utility-level data limitations and their often implicit nature. This paper develops a methodology to estimate water supply and sanitation subsidies that is adaptable to data scarce environments, while accounting for differences among service providers such as population served (to account for economies of scale), coverage of water and sanitation services individually, and their level of operational efficiency in terms of water losses and staffing. This methodology is based on Chile’s empresa modelo (model firm) approach to cost-reflective tariff estimation and uses utility-level data from the World Bank's International Benchmarking Network for Water and Sanitation Utilities database. The results suggest that the cost of subsidies associated with the operations, maintenance, and major repair and replacement of existing water supply and sanitation infrastructure in much of the world (excluding, notably, China and India) is an estimated $289 billion to $353 billion per year, or 0.46 to 0.56 percent of the countries' combined gross domestic product. This figure rises, shockingly, to 1.59 to 1.95 percent if only low- and middle-income economies are considered, an amount largely due to the capital subsidies captured in the estimation. Subsidies of operating costs account for approximately 22 percent of the total subsidy amount in the full sample and for low-income economies separately. Annual subsidy amounts by region range from 0.05 to 2.40 percent of gross domestic product, and low-income economies are generally at the high end of this range. The estimations do not include capital expenditure for infrastructure expansion -- which tends to be fully subsidized -- or environmental costs. Therefore, the actual global magnitude of networked water supply and sanitation subsidies is much greater than the estimation.\", 'last_modified_date': '2020-10-21T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Science and Technology Development,Water Resources,Health, Nutrition and Population,Environment,Water Supply and Sanitation'}\n",

This partial year effect in annual data leads to downward biased observations of the level of activity upon entry and upward biased growth rates between the year of entry and the following year. This paper examines the implications of partial year effects using Peruvian export data. The partial year bias is very large: the average level of first-year exports of new exporters is understated by 65 percent and the average growth rate between the first and second year of exporting is overstated by 112 percentage points. This paper re-examines a number of stylized facts about firm size and growth that have motivated rapidly expanding theoretical and empirical literatures on firm export dynamics. Correcting the partial year effect eliminates unusually high growth rates in the first year of exporting, raises initial export levels, and shifts 10 percent of market entrants from below to above the median size. Revisiting an older set of facts on firm size and growth, the paper finds that correcting for partial year biases reduces the number of small firms in the firm size distribution and weakens the negative relationship between firm growth and firm size.', 'last_modified_date': '2013-11-25T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Poverty Reduction,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Finance and Financial Sector Development'}\n",

The paper classifies firms into four ordinal categories: Not Credit Constrained, Maybe Credit Constrained, Partially Credit Constrained, and Fully Credit Constrained to understand the characteristics of the firms that fall into each group. Comparable data from the Enterprise Surveys for 116 countries are used to look at the relationship between firm size and credit-constrained status. First, the analysis finds that small and medium enterprises are more likely to be credit constrained (either partially or fully) than large firms. Furthermore, small and medium enterprises finance their working capital and investments mainly through trade credit and informal sources of finance. These two results hold to a large extent in all the regions of the developing world. Second, although size is a significant predictor of the probability of being credit constrained, firm age is not. Third, high-performing firms, as measured by labor productivity, are less likely to be credit constrained. This result applies to all firms but is not as strong for small firms as it is for large and medium firms. Finally, in countries with high private credit-to-gross domestic product ratios, firms are less likely to be credit constrained.

Coupling with economic strides, Vietnam has made impressive progress in opening up flows of information over recent decades. Internet penetration has grown rapidly, and citizens have more access to global and national news than ever before. Transparency of decision making by the state has also expanded. From the publishing of budgets and fiscal information, to draft laws, to televised sessions of the National Assembly, there is no doubt that Vietnam is a more transparent place than in decades past. The same holds true for land management, with successive legal changes gradually expanding the scope of information that is declared to be public information. At the same time, citizens and firms continue to report having difficulty finding the information they need, and problems such as corruption and the misuse and waste of resources continue to constrain Vietnam\\x92s progress. In the area of land management, surveys of the perceptions of citizens and firms point to limited implementation of the land transparency rules that do exist. Many experts have highlighted the need for Vietnam to greatly expand transparency in the next phase of modernizing its institutions.\", 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'N/A'}\n",

This paper investigates the role of inter-city transport costs in determining the income of Sub-Saharan African cities, using two new data sources. Specifically, it asks how important access to a large port city is for the income of hinterland cities in 15 countries. Satellite data on lights at night proxy for city economic activity, and shortest routes between cities are calculated using new road network data. Cost per unit of distance is identified by world oil prices. The results show that an oil price increase of the magnitude experienced between 2002 and 2008 induces the income of cities near a major port to increase by 6 percent relative to otherwise identical cities 500 kilometers farther away. Cities connected to the port by paved roads are chiefly affected by transport costs to the port, while cities connected to the port by unpaved roads are more affected by connections to secondary centers.

Four main findings are obtained. (1) The effective tax rates on labor and capital have converged globally since the 1960s, due to a 10 percentage-point increase in labor taxation and a 5 percentage-point decline in capital taxation. (2) The decline in capital taxation is concentrated in high-income countries. By contrast, capital taxation has increased in developing countries since the 1990s, albeit from a low base. (3) Consistently across a variety of research designs, the findings show that the rise in capital taxation in developing countries can be explained by a tax capacity effect of international trade: trade openness leads to a concentration of economic activity in formal corporate structures, where capital taxes are easier to impose. (4) At the same time, international economic integration reduces statutory tax rates, due to increased tax competition. In high-income countries, this negative tax competition effect of trade has dominated, while in developing countries, the positive tax-capacity effect of international trade appears to have prevailed.', 'last_modified_date': '2022-03-15T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Public Sector Development,Social Protections and Labor,International Economics and Trade'}\n",

Although most of the work happens at the national and sub-national level, regional cooperation is key for prospective advancement of building guidance strategies based on international best practices. Climate services are the core of regional development in forecasting and service delivery. At the center of developing effective climate services is the ability to translate climate into actionable guidance for decision support cutting across various sectors. South Asia Hydromet Forum (SAHF) works to reinforce national activities leading to a more sustainable program of rendering state of the art meteorological and hydrological services throughout the region. SAHF aims to identify specific fit-for-purpose investments towards building technical and intellectual capacity of Nation Meteorological and Hydrological Services to respond to the main users’ needs through overall skill development of the service professionals in the region in line with global standards. SAHF III expanded on SAHF I & II by largely focusing on service delivery, regional collaboration, and innovation, through adoption of a climate/early warning information value chain approach. SAHF III brought together a wide range of user and stakeholder institutions that connect NMHSs with the societal systems, climate sensitive sectors of the economy, academic and private institutions.

The authors present a new database on the administrative costs faced by private investors in 32 developing countries. The database is much more comprehensive than the existing sources, as it contains not only information on general entry procedures, such as business and tax registration, but also captures regulation on land access, site development, import procedures, and inspections, The data include measures on the number of procedures, direct monetary costs, and time. The cost of administrative procedures vary significantly across countries. The most important barriers appear to be the delays associated with securing land access, and obtaining building permits, which in several countries, take more than two years. Countries that impose excessive administrative costs on entry, tend to be equally intrusive in firm operations, thereby weakening the argument that barriers to entry, are a substitute for the government's unwillingness, or inability to regulate enterprise operations. The level of administrative costs is positively correlated with corruption incidence, and exhibits a negative correlation with the quality of governance, degree of openness, and public wages. These correlations suggest that administrative reforms, need to be incorporated into the broader agenda for reforms, such as trade and financial liberalization, the fight against corruption, and public sector administration.\", 'last_modified_date': '2002-07-02T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Health, Nutrition and Population'}\n",

The indicator proposes three dimensions to measure the effective implementation of public procurement systems in practice, as applied to a standardized recurrent infrastructure (roads) contract. The three dimensions include the steps and associated time required to complete the procurement process, and the availability and sophistication of e-procurement platforms. A final, fourth component benchmarks the regulatory framework applicable to such contracts. Economies that score higher in the indicator are those with more effective governments, higher quality of roads, and smaller perceptions of corruption. Looking more closely at the scores along the four dimensions reveals that countries differ to a lesser extent in terms of regulatory practices, compared with the use of new technologies such as e-procurement, where considerable gaps between economies exist.', 'last_modified_date': '2021-05-26T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Law and Development,Social Development,Governance,Transport,Private Sector Development,Public Sector Development'}\n",

This paper begins with an introduction of the domain and the rationale for an EMIS benchmarking tool. Chapter 1 then provides an overview of current data-related demands to improve education, explains how an EMIS meets those data demands, and highlights examples of specific system s in action. Chapter 2 outlines what matters in an EMIS, starting with an explanation of what comprises the construct validity and theoretical underpinnings for benchmarking an EMIs. This chapter shows that the guiding principles behind an EMIS drive actionable policies. A detailed description of four policy areas specifically, the enabling environment, system soundness, data quality, and utilization for decision making then follows in chapter 3. The chapter describes the rubric for the SABER-EMIS Tool and gives a brief overview of an EMIS benchmarking pilot, which demonstrated the feasibility of the concept. The last chapter describes how an EMIS is benchmarked, scored, and subsequently leads to a situation analysis. This assessment sequence provides an understanding of the strength and weaknesses of an EMIS system for fuller, more comprehensive depiction of its status.

The donors might interpret the World Bank\\'s policies and allocations across recipients as informative signals of where their own aid might be used most effectively. Alternatively, other donors might compensate for reduced IDA allocations by increasing their own aid. This paper shows that the signaling effect dominates any crowding out effects. The analysis uses panel data with country fixed effects and finds that aid from the bilateral donor countries is significantly reduced after countries cross the IDA income cutoff, controlling for other determinants of aid. Allocations by other donors are not sensitive to actual IDA disbursements, only to the IDA income threshold. Because crossing the income cutoff for eligibility significantly reduces aid levels from other donors as well as from the World Bank, government officials in recipient countries may have an incentive to manipulate their national accounts data to understate per capita income when it is near the IDA threshold. However, tests for \"bunching\" of observations just below the income threshold find no evidence to support data manipulation concerns.

Policy measures are quantified into a Services Trade Restrictions Index (STRI) following a novel, consistent and transparent framework. The paper identifies patterns of services trade policies across sectors and economies, and secular trends over the past decade. Higher income economies are still more open on average than developing economies, but the chronology of reform differs markedly across sectors. In telecommunications and finance, there is convergence toward greater openness driven by liberalization in the previously more restrictive developing economies. In the hitherto universally protected transport and professional services, there is policy divergence, as some higher income economies pioneer reform. But while explicit restrictions are being lowered in most services sectors—in contrast to recent developments in goods trade policy -- there is greater recourse to regulatory scrutiny, especially in higher income economies.

This study was produced as part of the Vietnam Transparency Project, an effort to systematically measure transparency, provide actionable advice on how to improve transparency, and analyze the causes and effects of transparency in Vietnam. If a country's political, economic, and social system was a human body, access to information would be the nervous system. Just as the nervous system tells the brain where we are, where we are going, whether we are tired or injured or hungry or thirsty, flows of information help ensure that decisions are made efficiently and that resources are used productively and fairly. Information helps ensure that the organizations that make up the body politic are performing as instructed, that decisions reflect the pains and pleasures of the people whom the state serves. Coupling with economic strides, Vietnam has made impressive progress in opening up flows of information over recent decades. Internet penetration has grown rapidly, and citizens have more access to global and national news than ever before. Transparency of decision making by the state has also expanded. From the publishing of budgets and fiscal information, to draft laws, to televised sessions of the National Assembly, there is no doubt that Vietnam is a more transparent place than in decades past. The same holds true for land management, with successive legal changes gradually expanding the scope of information that is declared to be public information. At the same time, citizens and firms continue to report having difficulty finding the information they need, and problems such as corruption and the misuse and waste of resources continue to constrain Vietnam\\x92s progress. In the area of land management, surveys of the perceptions of citizens and firms point to limited implementation of the land transparency rules that do exist.

However, regular series of strictly comparable data are only rarely available. Price deflators are also often missing or disputed. In response, poverty prediction methods that track consumption correlates as opposed to consumption itself have been developed. These methods typically assume that the estimated relation between consumption and its predictors is stable over time -- an assumption that cannot usually be tested directly. This study analyzes the performance of poverty prediction models based on small area estimation techniques. Predicted poverty estimates are compared with directly observed levels in two country settings where data comparability over time is not a problem. Prediction models that employ either non-staple food or non-food expenditures or a full set of assets as predictors are found to yield poverty estimates that match observed poverty well. This offers some support to the use of such methods to approximate the evolution of poverty.

The validity of a DCE, therefore, depends on the appropriate specification of the attributes and their levels. There have been recent calls for greater rigor in implementing and reporting on the processes of developing attributes and attribute-levels for discrete choice experiments (DCEs). This paper responds to such calls by carefully reporting a systematic process of developing micro health insurance attributes and attribute-levels for the design of a DCE in rural Malawi. Conceptual attributes and attribute-levels were initially derived from a literature review which informed the design of qualitative data collection tools to identify context specific attributes and attribute-levels. Qualitative data was collected in August-September 2012 from 12 focus group discussions with community residents and 8 in-depth interviews with health workers. First, a consensus, emerging from an individual level analysis of the qualitative transcripts, identified 10 candidate attributes. Levels were assigned to all attributes based on data from transcripts and knowledge of the Malawian context, derived from literature. Second, through further discussions with experts, four attributes were discarded based on multiple criteria. The 6 remaining attributes were: premium level, unit of enrollment, management structure, health service benefit package, transportation coverage and copayment levels. A final step of revision and piloting confirmed that the retained attributes satisfied the credibility criteria of DCE attributes. This detailed description makes our attribute development process transparent, and provides the reader with a basis to assess the rigor of this stage of constructing the DCE. This paper contributes empirical evidence to the limited methodological literature on attributes and levels development for DCE, thereby providing further empirical guidance on the matter, specifically within rural communities of low- and middle-income countries.', 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Health, Nutrition and Population,Law and Development,Communities and Human Settlements'}\n",

This may have adverse consequences for both labor market volatility and wage dispersion. The authors argue that while the case that trade liberalization should increase own-wage elasticities may be broadly compelling for competitive import-competing industries, it is less so for imperfectly competitive, nontradable, or export industries. They test the hypothesis using establishment-level panel data from three countries with periods of liberalization.

The empirical literature has not been able to conclusively establish the presumed growth benefits of financial integration. Indeed, a new literature proposes that the indirect benefits of financial integration may be more important than the traditional financing channel emphasized in previous analyses. A major complication, however, is that there seem to be certain \"threshold\" levels of financial and institutional development that an economy needs to attain before it can derive the indirect benefits and reduce the risks of financial openness. This paper develops a unified empirical framework for characterizing such threshold conditions. The analysis finds that there are clearly identifiable thresholds in variables such as financial depth and institutional quality -- the cost-benefit trade-off from financial openness improves significantly once these threshold conditions are satisfied. The findings also show that the thresholds are lower for foreign direct investment and portfolio equity liabilities compared with those for debt liabilities.', 'last_modified_date': '2009-12-07T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Private Sector Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Poverty Reduction,Finance and Financial Sector Development'}\n",

Using data from 164 countries comprising 97 percent of the world's population, this paper simulates a set of scenarios for global poverty from 2018 to 2030 under different assumptions about growth and inequality. This allows for quantifying the interdependence of the poverty and inequality goals. The paper uses different assumptions about growth incidence curves to model changes in inequality and relies on the Model-based Recursive Partitioning machine-learning algorithm to model how growth in GDP is passed through to growth as observed in household surveys. When holding within-country inequality unchanged and letting GDP per capita grow according to International Monetary Fund forecasts, the simulations suggest that the number of extreme poor (living below $1.90/day) will remain above 550 million in 2030, resulting in a global extreme poverty rate of 6.5 percent. If the Gini index in each country decreases by 1 percent per year, the global poverty rate could reduce to around 5.4 percent in 2030, equivalent to 100 million fewer people living in extreme poverty. Reducing each country's Gini index by 1 percent per year has a larger impact on global poverty than increasing each country's annual growth 1 percentage point above the forecasts, suggesting an important role for inequality on the path to eliminating extreme poverty.\", 'last_modified_date': '2019-05-30T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'International Economics and Trade,Poverty Reduction,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Industry'}\n",

The authors compare the \"before reform\" with \"after reform\" GDP growth outcome of countries that undertook import-liberalization and fiscal policy reforms. They survey a large sample (about 54) of developing countries over the period 1980-99. The benefits of openness to trade and fiscal prudence have been extensively identified in the growth literature, but the evidence from simple cross-section analysis can sometimes be inconclusive and remains vulnerable to criticism on estimation techniques, such as identification, endogeneity, multi-colinearity, and the quality of the data. The authors use a different analytical framework that establishes additional controls. First, they construct a counterfactual control group. These are countries that-under specific thresholds-did not introduce policy reforms under scrutiny. Second, the authors also try to use the most appropriate variable of policy reform, for example, exogenous changes in import-tariffs instead of the endogenous sum of all trade flows. Third, the authors try to base the before-after reform comparison on the most accurate date for the beginning of a policy reform period (instead of comparing averages over fixed intervals of time). Once these controls are set, they explain the difference between average GDP growth rates during the country-specific post and the pre-reform periods, relative to the average GDP growth of the relevant control group. The explanatory variables in the regressions include the standard growth-regression controls. The results are the following: 1) With a better measurement and timing of the policy reforms, the growth effect (the \"returns on reform\") is generally smaller than in previous papers. 2) There is evidence of contingent relationships between policy and growth, corresponding to the country\\'s size, its export profile, and its governance. 2) Within the group of policy reformers, some countries have exhibited a relatively weaker growth response. Overall, the findings suggest that more accurate measurement and definition of the timing of reforms does not strengthen the significance of the effects of reforms on GDP growth. In fact, the effects are weaker than indicated in most cross-section studies.

Twenty-eight countries, mostly high-income economies, responded to the questionnaire. The survey responses provide detailed information about various approaches to the sovereign asset and liability management framework in terms of balance sheet production as well as objectives, priority areas, and challenges associated with integrated management. In addition to the survey results, where possible and relevant, this paper provides insight through prominent country examples. The survey results confirm that the number of countries that have developed such a framework is limited. Although most of the respondents indicated that they regularly produce an accounting balance sheet, the objective of this exercise is often limited to monitoring sovereign assets and liabilities rather than determining mismatches between them. In the cases where a sovereign asset and liability management framework is implemented, there are significant differences across countries. Most countries include state-owned enterprises in the sovereign balance sheet, but only a minority also considers central banks, in some cases only international reserves and sovereign funds. The challenges cited include institutional arrangements, uncertain or lacking mandate, coordination between institutions, data availability, and valuation of assets. Most of these challenges are related to the implementation of the approach. The development of sound practices for sovereign asset and liability management could benefit governments and facilitate the implementation of a holistic approach to manage their balance sheets and related risks, increasing their resilience to shocks.', 'last_modified_date': '2018-10-25T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,International Economics and Trade,Finance and Financial Sector Development,Public Sector Development,Governance'}\n",

The indicators combine analysis of laws and regulations, as well as their implementation. They explore differences across countries to identify good practices, facilitate learning opportunities, stimulate reforms, and provide cross-country data for research and analysis. The project's methodology is based on the World Bank Group's Doing Business initiative. The IAB indicators draw on data collected through a survey of lawyers, other professional service providers (mainly accounting and consulting firms), investment promotion institutions, chambers of commerce, and other expert respondents in each of the countries measured. Between April and December 2009 more than 2,350 experts in 87 economies responded to the survey to provide data for this report. This chapter presents the report's main findings including examples of FDI competitiveness-enhancing practices for each indicator area. It also provides key results for each region.

With COVID-19 predicted to push up to 100 million additional people into extreme poverty in 2020, trends in global poverty rates will be set back at least three years over the next decade.

Data from the three waves of the Life in Transition surveys of European countries show that these perceptions systematically deviate from the rankings obtained using consumption levels. People position themselves in the middle ranks in larger numbers than those who are in the middle ranks according to their consumption levels. Correspondingly, many people who objectively are classified in the top, richest, or bottom, poorest, ranks subjectively feel that they are in the middle class. This puzzling \"bunching in the middle\" is the focus of this paper. Explanations are tested and discarded that consider subjective perceptions as misperceptions or the result of other mistakes due to data limitations (such as tail bias). The paper concludes that rather than reflecting a subjective assessment of the distribution of welfare, subjective rankings reveal subjective economic well-being. The paper show that monetary consumption is a strong predictor of subjective economic well-being, but that the latter is influenced by many other factors, including economic security, proxied by employment status or other measures of human capital, such as health and education. These findings have policy relevance, since redistribution measures aiming at simply protecting consumption levels may not be sufficient to restore the economic well-being provided by having full-time secure types of employment.', 'last_modified_date': '2020-10-27T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Social Development,Industry,Education,Poverty Reduction,Gender'}\n",

Although access to finance can be very beneficial, the data show that universal use is far from prevalent in many countries, especially developing countries. At the same time, universal access has generally not been a public policy objective and is surely not easily achievable in most countries. Countries can, however, undertake many actions to facilitate access to financial services, including through strengthening their institutional infrastructures, liberalizing and opening up their markets and facilitating greater competition, and encouraging innovative use of know-how and technology.

Recent studies have shown the challenges faced in Africa by this population, especially women, but it remains unknown in Cambodia and the Lao People's Democratic Republic, despite large trade facilitation investments. This paper fills this gap, thanks to an innovative mix of original qualitative and quantitative data from various checkpoints on the borders with Thailand and Vietnam. The quantitative data, collected in 2014, consist of an exhaustive list of trade-related border crossings during two to three days and a survey of 158 randomly selected small-scale, cross-border traders and brokers. The paper combines qualitative data and statistical techniques to shed light on the structure of the small-scale, cross-border trade economy, traders' and brokers' profiles, the challenges they face, and potential solutions, with a particular emphasis on gender. Key challenges pertain to taxation and poor infrastructures. Narrow roads, insufficient parking space, and restrictive border regulations on transportation means cause traffic jams and delays. These disproportionately affect women, who are more time constrained. Despite a rather moderate tax pressure, widespread informal payments erode traders' and brokers' willingness to comply with taxes. Women suffer from a higher tax rate and a tax schedule that deters them from upgrading to more profitable cross-border trade activities. Along with capital constraints, this finding may explain the lower share of women in small-scale, cross-border trade than among own-account workers and the self-employed, as evidenced by nationally representative data. The paper delineates policy implications and puts forward concrete steps.\", 'last_modified_date': '2017-11-21T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Gender,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,International Economics and Trade'}\n",

Female farmers participate less, but tend to sell larger shares of their production, conditionalon participation.

Overall, the findings based on the preferable double machine-learning approach differ across the two countries depending on the measures of early childhood development and child stature (height-for-age Z-score and stunting) used in the analysis. Double machine-learning estimates for the Republic of Congo suggest that height-for-age Z-score and stunting have a direct causal effect on early childhood development. In contrast, for São Tomé and Príncipe, no relationship is found.

Services account for over one fifth of global cross-border trade, and for some countries such as India and the United States close to a third of all exports. New data on cross-border trade from the United States reveals that since mid-2008, trade in goods declined drastically but trade in some services is holding up remarkably well. More aggregate data available for other Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries also suggests that services trade has suffered less from the crisis than goods trade. Initial evidence suggests that services trade is buoyant relative to goods trade for two reasons: demand for a range of traded services is less cyclical, and services trade and production are less dependent on external finance. If further investigation confirms that trade in certain services is inherently less affected by crises, then these services could play a more prominent role in developing countries' diversification strategies. The apparent resilience of services trade may be jeopardized by protectionism. Even though few explicitly trade-restrictive measures have so far been taken in services, the changing political climate and the widening boundaries of the state in crisis countries could introduce a national bias in firms' choices regarding procurement and the location of economic activity.\", 'last_modified_date': '2018-03-18T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Public Sector Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,International Economics and Trade,Communities and Human Settlements'}\n",

This edition brings the unwelcome news that COVID-19, along with conflict and climate change, has not merely slowed global poverty reduction but reversed it for first time in over twenty years. With COVID-19 predicted to push up to 100 million additional people into extreme poverty in 2020, trends in global poverty rates will be set back at least three years over the next decade. Today, 40 percent of the global poor live in fragile or conflict-affected situations, a share that could reach two-thirds by 2030. Multiple effects of climate change could drive an estimated 65 to 129 million people into poverty in the same period. 'Reversing the reversal~^!!^ will require responding effectively to COVID-19, conflict, and climate change while not losing focus on the challenges that most poor people continue to face most of the time. Though these are distinctive types of challenges, there is much to be learned from the initial response to COVID-19 that has broader implications for development policy and practice, just as decades of addressing more familiar development challenges yield insights that can inform responses to today’s unfamiliar but daunting ones. Solving novel problems requires rapid learning, open cooperation, and strategic coordination by everyone: from political leaders and scientists to practitioners and citizens.\", 'last_modified_date': '2020-10-08T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Environment,Science and Technology Development,Social Protections and Labor,Health, Nutrition and Population,Education,Poverty Reduction'}\n",

This paper is the first to evaluate a reform by a technical agency, namely, the agency responsible for food safety and animal health in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.

            "{'id': '437752', 'abstract': 'The Egyptian food subsidy system is an untargeted system that is essentially open to all Egyptians. For this reason, the budgetary costs of this system have been high, and the ability of this system to improve the welfare status of the poor has been questioned. Since the food riots of 1977, Egyptian policymakers have been reluctant to make large changes in their food subsidy system. Rather, their strategy has been to reduce the costs, and coverage of this system gradually. For example, since 1980 policymakers have reduced the number of subsidized foods from 20 to just four. Despite these cutbacks, the author uses new 1997 household survey data to show that the Egyptian food subsidy system IS self-targeted to the poor, because it subsidizes \"inferior\" goods. In urban Egypt, for instance, the main subsidized food - coarse baladi bread - is consumed more by the poor (the lowest quintile group of the population) than by the rich (the highest quintile). So subsidizing baladi bread is a good way of improving the welfare status of the urban poor. Bur in rural Egypt, where the poor do not consume so much baladi bread, the poor receive less in income transfers than the rich. In many countries, administrative targeting of food subsidies can do a better job of targeting the poor than self-targeting systems. In Jamaica, for example, poor people get food stamps at health clinics, so the Jamaican poor receive double the income transfers from food subsidies than the Egyptian poor receive. Bur starting a comparable system in Egypt, would be costly both in financial, and political terms, because many non-poor households currently receiving food subsidies would have to be excluded. For these reasons, it is likely that the government will continue to refine the present food subsidy system, perhaps by eliminating current subsidies on sugar or edible oil. Neither of these foods is an \"inferior\" good, so eliminating these subsidies will have only a minimal impact on the welfare status of the poor.', 'last_modified_date': '2000-05-25T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Poverty Reduction'}\n",

Monthly data show that industrial sector growth is positive, credit off-take has improved, and trade is stabilizing. The external sector is helping growth in a national accounting sense, because imports fell faster than exports. Financial markets are back to normal with a recovery of the Bombay stock exchange to an 18-month high, and near re-adjustment of the risk spread on Indian debt instruments. Inflation is resurfacing because the base effect of high energy prices last year is diminishing, and food price inflation is high, not least because of a deficient monsoon. Fiscal stimulus supported aggregate demand to the tune of 3.5 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) during 2008-09 because of the sixth pay commission awards and three fiscal stimulus packages. Monetary policy appears to be at a crossroad, with interest rates held stable due to the dilemma between high consumer price indices (CPIs) and low wholesale price index (WPI) inflation indicators. Looking forward, the external economic environment is stabilizing, but difficulties continue and Indian economic growth will have to rely more on domestic factors. The short-term forecast for India is cautiously optimistic, with growth in the current year projected at 6 percent, and a sharper recovery to 7.5 percent next fiscal year. Fiscal policy provides more stimulus with an increase in the overall deficit to about 10.3 percent of GDP envisaged for 2009-10, one percent of GDP higher than the already high deficit of 2008-09. Monetary policy walks the tightrope between accommodation and vigilance, as the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) aims to ensure that the high government borrowing requirement does not crowd out private sector borrowing on one hand, and does not cause the reemergence of inflation on the other. The paper concludes with a discussion of the role of capital flows and the exchange rate, highlighting the constraints on policies in an economy that has become more and more open to international trade and capital flows.', 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Private Sector Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Finance and Financial Sector Development'}\n",

This literature postulates that total factor productivity is higher when trade gives countries access to a wider or more sophisticated range of technologies. The articles reviewed here find considerable evidence that imported technologies raise total factor productivity in importing countries, particularly developing countries and particularly when technologies are acquired by way of imports of intermediate goods. They also provide some support for the argument that exports and foreign direct investment are channels for learning. Although access to foreign technologies has a positive impact on developing countries' total factor productivity, overall these countries are shown to purchase older and simpler machines than industrial countries. Relative factor and machinery costs and skill and technology endowments affect the choice of imported technologies. However, government attempts to limit or guide the selection of technologies are likely to have a negative effect on growth because they discourage producers from purchasing the most appropriate and efficient machines. Rather, policies aimed at promoting technological development should strengthen the absorptive capacity of importing countries and address the complementarity between human and physical capital in a broader context.\", 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Agriculture,Private Sector Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Information and Communication Technologies,Industry'}\n",

The methodology contributes to the existing literature by employing repeated cross sections of data to track the life cycle path of representative groups of individuals belonging to a birth cohort, by constructing and analyzing a synthetic data base of household survey data from 18 countries. A key finding is that while upper secondary enrollment rates increased in the region, the proportion of upper secondary age youth dropping out of school has remained persistently high, despite relatively favorable macroeconomic conditions. Furthermore, the study traces the moment in the life cycle at which the majority of dropout takes place to reveal differences between countries. Finally, to explain the trends in upper secondary dropout rates, the study examines the impact of three groups of factors: (i) shifts in the cohort size and socioeconomic composition of the population eligible for entering upper secondary education; (b) the macroeconomic environment and labor market opportunities; and (c) the returns to schooling. A series of regressions shows that an important factor that may be driving higher dropout levels has been the higher numbers of students from poor socioeconomic backgrounds reaching the upper secondary level. In addition, high returns to education have been a pull factor into the schooling system, while, especially in countries where the majority of youth dropout early (prior to upper secondary education), the data confirm an apparent substitution effect due to the opportunity cost of forgoing employment opportunities. Overall, the findings confirm the importance of policy makers' focus on upper secondary education across Latin America and suggest implications for focusing the policy agenda.\", 'last_modified_date': '2015-03-26T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Education,Rural Development,Social Protections and Labor'}\n",

One method which has received considerable attention and success is the purchasing power parity. \"Purchasing power parity (PPP) is a disarmingly simple theory which holds that the nominal exchange rate between two currencies should be equal to the ratio of aggregate price levels between the two countries, so that a unit of currency of one country will have the same purchasing power in a foreign country\" (Taylor and Taylor, 2004p1). Since 1968, the International Comparison Program (ICP), a partnership between the World Bank, OECD, the UN system and many other development agencies in collaboration with (in 2011) 181 countries, has been tasked with developing practical applications for applying PPPs to compare output of economies and the welfare of their people in real terms. Calculating PPPs requires a common volume and price measurement system which act as a conversion factor to adjust or measure GDP, GNI, etc. There have been some criticisms of PPP, but with recent advances in theory and methodological application, some variant of PPPs have become accepted as a means to calculate real exchange rates (Rogoff, 1996). Although initially designed to serve monetary policies with regard to exchange rates, PPP has come to be used as a weighting mechanism for a variety of other areas by many international organizations: \"international poverty headcount index (World Bank), comparing relative sizes of economies and estimating weighted averages of regional growth rates (IMF), allocation of structural and cohesion funds (European Commission), Human Development Index (UNDP), gender empowerment measures (UNDP), health inequality assessment (World Health Organization), assessing per capita expenditures in education (U.N.

The results show that bilateral trade liberalization with the United States is likely to have almost no effect on welfare in Honduras, while the reciprocal removal of protection vis-a-vis the rest of Central America would lead to significantly larger gains. Potential gains from increased net foreign direct investment inflows overwhelm those expected from trade reform alone, particularly if the new foreign direct investment generates productivity spillovers. However, if it is to replace Honduran investment rather than complement domestic capital formation, growth performance is unlikely to improve and may even suffer. The paper's results identify several areas for policy attention by Honduran policy makers to make the Dominican Republic-Central American Free Trade Agreement more development-friendly. These include carefully considering the budgetary implications of trade reform, widening social safety nets to counter the trends toward increasing income inequality, and sequencing the reforms to ensure a close alignment of Honduras' comparative advantage on the regional and global markets.\", 'last_modified_date': '2018-03-18T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Finance and Financial Sector Development,Private Sector Development,International Economics and Trade'}\n",

Thus, its alternative may be to become highly competitive in banking services, including exporting these services. Based on substantiated evidence, it is suggested that the comparative advantage of Uruguayan banks is gradually eroding, but should it become competitive, the country could export some banking services, provided it explores setting up a regional stock exchange within MERCOSUR, which may well improve liquidity, rather than revive local exchanges; improve the constrained private participation (resulting from a preponderant State role); and, strengthen regulatory, and supervisory framework.\", 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Finance and Financial Sector Development'}\n",

Yet, when one focuses on the intensive margin (i.e., on the changes in the quantities of already existing exports), a large and significant exchange rate response is found after controlling for global and Chinese demand for imports, with a significant resumption of export volume growth detected for the post-2011 slowdown years and mainly occurring in SA countries with the most flexible exchange rate regimes. Micro data thus confirms the findings mentioned earlier based on aggregate observations. Second, when one focuses on the extensive margin (i.e., on the changes in the quantities of new exports), a pick-up in volume growth is detected in the slowdown years. Although still mainly concentrated in primary commodities, the new products that the region is now exporting tend to be of higher quality, they appear at higher relative prices and in product categories that offer more room for value upgrading, compared to the boom years. Interestingly, when it comes to higher quality new exports, neither trade structures nor the real exchange rate appear to matter. However, the client’s wealth does seem to matter, as new exports are tilted towards the richer US market. This finding suggests that exporters in LAC are making efforts to exploit new niches and the branching out toward the higher end is indeed promising when one looks farther into the future. Third, a process of export diversification (defined by an increasing number of export-destination pairs) is detected, whichhas gathered strength during the slowdown years in the LAC countries with the most flexible exchange rate regimes. Yet, the elasticity with which the diversification of exports responds to a real exchange rate depreciation declines with economic size. Overall, this is again good news as it further confirms the importance of exchange rate flexibility, particularly for smaller economies which have greater scope for diversification. Overall, the key messages of this report are positive in that the macroeconomic adjustment the region requires, while far from completed for many countries, is on its way. Trade adjustment is also materializing under both a push effect (higher competitiveness and the creativity of local exporters) and a pull effect (the demand from richer countries for upscale products). However, whether and how fast both adjustments will allow growth to resume on a sustainable basis remains an open question.

The analysis is based on a unique data set combining panel household survey data with in-depth qualitative interviews of a subsample of male and female beneficiaries from the survey data collected between 2009 and 2015. By combining quantitative and qualitative information, the paper draws a more nuanced picture of how household characteristics—structural and temporal—contextualize opportunities for poor men and women and their households and shape how well they can leverage access to the Vision 2020 Umurenge Programme to accumulate productive assets. The mixed method analysis reveals that household composition, gender power dynamics, disability, care responsibilities, marital arrangements, intrahousehold communication, and access to other social programs and institutions play a crucial role in access to the Vision 2020 Umurenge Programme and related asset accumulation. The findings suggest that households would benefit from a broader definition of the eligibility criteria and the availability of flexible and complementary programming, to reap the benefits of the income transfer received from the program.\", 'last_modified_date': '2019-02-28T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Rural Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Gender,Agriculture,Poverty Reduction,Social Protections and Labor'}\n",

President Conable states how honored he is to take part in the important deliberations on the future of the world's trading system. He goes on to say, to many, this risk may not seem so clear. Last year, world trade grew about five percent; this year it may grow even faster. While this growth is still below the rate of the 1960's 8.5 percent, it equals the 1970's average. The United States' economy is still undergoing a record long expansion; exports and imports are growing strongly. Europe and East Asia have also done well. The most rapidly growing trade over the past 10 years has been in East Asia, as you might expect; East Asian trade has ·grown one-third faster than world trade. Facilitated by the EEC and its agreements with the European Free Trade Association, Western Europe's trade grew six percent faster than the world average. Equally satisfactory has been the surprisingly rapid growth of developing countries' manufactured exports. The development doctrine of import substitution propagated in the 1950s; a doctrine based on pessimism. In spite of this buoyancy, there has been a strong move away from support for an open trading world. Some current statistics disguise this evolving crisis in world trade.

Yet average workers' earnings have stagnated, and earnings of those with higher schooling have fallen, compressing the earnings distribution and lowering the returns to education. This paper argues that distortions that misallocate resources toward less-productive firms explain these phenomena, because these firms are less intensive in well-educated workers compared with more-productive ones. It shows that while the relative supply of workers with more years of schooling has increased, misallocation of resources toward less productive firms has persisted. These two trends have generated a widening mismatch between the supply of, and the demand for, educated workers. The paper breaks down worker earnings into observable and unobservable firm and individual worker characteristics, and computes a counterfactual earnings distribution in the absence of misallocation. The main finding is that in the absence of misallocation average earnings would be higher, and that earnings differentials across schooling levels would widen, raising the returns to education. A no-misallocation path is constructed for the wage premium. Depending on parameter values, this path is found to be rising or constant, in contrast to the observed downward path. The paper concludes arguing that the persistence of misallocation impedes Mexico from taking full advantage of its investments in the education of its workforce.\", 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Poverty Reduction,Education,Social Protections and Labor,Rural Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Industry'}\n",

There are four components to the project, the first component being regional digital connectivity infrastructure. This component will support targeted public sector financing aimed at catalyzing private sector investments in the deployment of additional domestic and regional digital connectivity infrastructure and creating a more competitive environment in the sector, while also providing connectivity services for the Government’s own internal use. This component includes two subcomponents: improving regional connectivity; and increasing the security, capacity and reach of the Government network. The second component is the regional datacenters, digital platforms, and smart solutions. This component will focus on establishing solid technology foundations for the digital economy and digital government including regionally integrated shared datacenter infrastructure and digital platforms that can be reused at regional and national levels. The project will also support the development of a select number of innovative citizen/business‐facing digital applications leveraging shared digital infrastructure, platforms, and data (including open data), to offer ‘quick‐win’ smart solutions at regional and national levels. The third component is the enabling environment for digital economy. This component includes two subcomponents: legal, regulatory and institutional foundations for digital economy; regional partnerships for digital economy skills, jobs and innovations; and digital leadership and strategic communications.

It was first published in 2008, applied to Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). The findings were eye-opening: behind the enormous inequality that characterizes the region's distribution of development outcomes (income, land ownership and educational attainment, among others), there is an even more worrying inequality of development opportunities. It is not only rewards that are unequal; it is also chances. The problem is not just about equality; it is about equity too. The playing field is uneven from the start. This book reports on the status and evolution of human opportunity in LAC. It builds on the 2008 publication in several directions. First, it uses newly-available data to expand the set of opportunities and personal circumstances under analysis. The data is representative of some 200 million children living in 19 countries over the last 15 years. Second, it compares human opportunity in LAC with that of developed countries, among them the US and France, two very different models of social policy. This allows for illuminating exercises in benchmarking and extrapolation. And third, it looks at human opportunity within countries across regions, states and cities. This gives us a preliminary glimpse at the geographic dimension of equity, and at the role that different federal structures play. The overall message that emerges is one of cautious hope. LAC is making progress in opening the doors of development to all. But it still has a long way to go. At the current pace, it would take, on average, a generation for the region to achieve universal access to just the basic services that make for human opportunity.

It increases sharply as income rises, up to a per capita income of about $ 5,000 (Penn World table purchasing parity income), before declining modestly. The best degree of concentration declines with country scale. Growth losses from significantly non-optimal concentration are large. Those losses tend to rise with level of development, peaking at a very high level (about 1.5 annual percentage points of economic growth). Results are very robust. 2) In a group of 72 countries in 1990, roughly 30 have satisfactory urban concentration, 24 have excessive concentration, and 5 to 16 countries have too little. 3) The list of countries with highly excessive concentration includes Argentina, Chile, Costa Rica, and Panama (in Latin America); the Republic of Korea and Thailand (in Asia); Congo (in Africa); and Greece, Ireland, and Portugal (in Europe). Many of these countries have explicitly unitary governments or federal structures have traditionally been severely constrained. 4) The list of countries with too little urban concentration includes Belgium (a small, split country) and special cases such as Czechoslovakia and the former Yugoslavia. 5) Urban concentration declines with national scale. It initially rises with income, the peaks at a per capita income of about $ 3,000, before declining. If the largest city in a country is a port, increased trade leads to increased urban concentration. Otherwise, increased trade leads to deconcentration as markets i the hinterland open up to trade. But trade effects are modest. 5) Similarly, more political decentralization (or increased federalism) only modestly reduces urban concentration.

The first tranche of SAP (SAP 1), however, experienced significant delivery challenges. This experience led to several changes in the operation of the second tranche of SAP (SAP 2). This case study aims to document the lessons learned from the implementation of the SAP 2, specifically focusing on the digital G2P (government to persons) payment delivery. Digital delivery in SAP 2 was a significant departure from SAP 1 which almost entirely relied on manual processing and physical cash delivery except for the beneficiaries of the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program (4Ps), the country’s flagship safety net program. It is also an important milestone where GoP introduced large-scale G2P payments through multiple Financial Service Providers (FSPs) beyond the state-owned Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP).

All surveyed economies recognize arbitration as a tool for resolving commercial disputes and only nine economies have not acceded to the New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards. In the Arbitrating and Mediating Disputes indicators, High Income OECD and Eastern Europe and Central Asia are the regions that reformed their laws on alternative dispute resolution the most between 2011 and 2012. The data also show that, globally, arbitration proceedings take 326 days on average, while recognition and enforcement proceedings of foreign arbitral awards take 557 days on average.

To accomplish this task, the authors collected a panel data set of 136 countries over 1960-2010, and estimated cross-country growth regressions using an econometric methodology that accounts for unobserved effects and the likely endogeneity of the growth determinants. Following recent empirical efforts, they tested whether the impact of trade openness on growth may be more effective after surpassing a \"minimum threshold\" in specific areas closely related to economic development. The analysis finds not only that there is a robust causal link from trade to growth, but also that the growth benefits from trade are larger in countries with higher levels of education and innovation, deeper financial markets, a stronger institutional framework, more developed infrastructure networks, a high level of integration with world capital markets, and less stringent economic regulations.

In these situations, teams should exercise additional care when preparing the results framework, choosing indicators that do not directly depend on problematic data. During both design and restructuring, due to problems with the official population data, the team did not understand how far Eritrea had actually come with regard to providing access to elementary education.

Although the Ministry of Education (MOE) and donors discussed and drafted a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for donor coordination, the government and donors did not pursue the idea of stronger coordination. Project teams and Bank management should be cautious when making decisions on accepting donor trust funds that more than double the size of projects, particularly when the majority is for civil works.

As globalized world continues to be gripped by an economic downturn, few countries are spared from having to wrestle with the consequences for their people of unanticipated economic shocks and unmet expectations for good jobs. After extensive consultation and dialogue with clients, stakeholders and practitioners about needs in this fast-changing world, we have designed the strategy with a core focus: to move SPL from isolated interventions to a coherent connected portfolio of programs. This systemic approach helps countries to address the fragmentation and duplication across programs, and to create financing, governance and solutions tailored to their own contexts. A focus on systems is not an end in itself. It is a gateway to deliver outcomes. Effective SPL systems build resilience by ensuring that individuals and families are well-protected against the sudden shocks that are likely to overwhelm them. They improve equity at both national and global levels by reducing poverty and destitution with strong support to people in low income countries, and those in the informal sector. And they promote opportunity to improve people's productivity and incomes, through preserving and building their human capital, and through access to better jobs and income which can propel them out of poverty. The strategy is designed to help harness knowledge management in key ways: by generating evidence and lessons to inform effective policies; promoting South-South knowledge sharing and open access to data and information; and providing global leadership in research, analysis and data management. Today, SPL at the World Bank is a young, strong sector, accounting for a significant share of Bank lending and knowledge and serving as a global leader in its work on evidence-based policy-making.

Over the last 10 years, however, domestic investment, while stagnant in real terms, has shrunk as a share of GDP. In an open and growing economy, why the decline Three reasons explain the puzzle. First, the public sector cannot afford expanding its investment at GDP growth rates. Second, the capital-intensive private sector does not find it convenient to raise investment at the economy\\'s pace. Third, fast-growing businesses in the service sector do not need to rapidly increase investment to enjoy rising profits. Yet, the economy keeps growing. On the demand-side, massive labor migration results in remittances that fuel consumption-led-growth. On the supply-side, free from rent-capturing regulations, a few non-capital-intensive manufactures and services boost exports. The economic system is in equilibrium at a low level of capital stock, where all economic agents have no incentive to unilaterally increase investment and the first mover bears short-term costs. As a consequence, growth is slower and less inclusive than it could be. To make it speedier and more sustainable, and to reduce unemployment and poverty, the economy needs to move to a \"high-capital-stock\" equilibrium.

The authors seek to identify and empirically examine the factors that have influenced Singapore's unemployment rate in an environment of low and stable inflation. They incorporate a union bargaining framework into a standard-factors trade model, in which an increase in the relative price or capital stock in the export sector raises the demand wage that firms can afford to pay relative to workers' fall-back income, and consequently lowers equilibrium unemployment. The magnitude of the effects depends on the fall-back income, the weight unions attach to employment, and the elasticity of labor demand, which the authors estimate using data on Singapore. The results show that labor unions in Singapore care more about employment than wages. Together with a small fall-back income and elastic labor demand, the authors show that given the same percentage change in relative export prices and capital accumulation in the export sector, the effect on unemployment is larger for the former. However, the empirical importance of capital accumulation in the export sector dominates increases in relative export prices in reducing unemployment since the manufacturing sector experienced a tremendous increase in capital inputs throughout the sample period, whereas the relative price of exports experienced a far smaller increase and only in the early part of the sample period. The authors conclude that through a very open trading regime, the tremendous increase in capital stock of the exporting sector has been the main reason behind Singapore's declining unemployment rate.\", 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Finance and Financial Sector Development'}\n",

First chapter, 'a framework for SSN reform,' describes and illustrates the reasons for the region's growing need for SSN reform and establishes the framework for renewed SSNs. It identifies key goals for SSNs (promoting social inclusion, livelihood, and resilience) and illustrates how these goals have been achieved in some parts of the region and elsewhere.

A simple general-equilibrium model with sector-specific factors of production can be combined with the tariff indices to calculate how a preferential trade arrangement affects sectoral output, factor prices, and general welfare. The general equilibrium model is simple enough that it can be calculated on an Excel spreadsheet, and is flexible enough to be used with different ranges of available domestic data. The author presents an example of the model, simulating the effects of free trade agreements between Chile and MERCOSUR countries and between Chile and NAFTA countries. Calculations for the case of Chile show that the index is simple to calculate because of its recursive structure, which allows large amounts of detailed tariff line data to be aggregated for use with domestic production data that is available only at a more aggregated level. The author finds that results using the tariff aggregators may differ substantially from those derived using simpler averages of tariff reductions. Reductions in import prices using the index were 10 to 30 percent larger than those calculated using a simple average of tariffs. Ignoring the information available in tariff line data could lead to a substantial overestimate of the average tariff rate on imports after a preferential reduction.

Several of these are located in areas associated with high levels of air pollution. This study investigates the relationship between exposure to particulate matter and COVID-19 incidence in 355 municipalities in the Netherlands. The results show that atmospheric particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 is a highly significant predictor of the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and related hospital admissions. The estimates suggest that expected COVID-19 cases increase by nearly 100 percent when pollution concentrations increase by 20 percent. The association between air pollution and case incidence is robust in the presence of data on health-related preconditions, proxies for symptom severity, and demographic control variables. The results are obtained with ground-measurements and satellite-derived measures of atmospheric particulate matter as well as COVID-19 data from alternative dates. The findings call for further investigation into the association between air pollution and SARS-CoV-2 infection risk. If particulate matter plays a significant role in COVID-19 incidence, it has strong implications for the mitigation strategies required to prevent spreading.', 'last_modified_date': '2020-05-05T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Social Development,Industry,Environment'}\n",

This paper aims to explain this paradox by combining a model of conflict intensity at the province level over period 2007-14 with a model of consumption at the household level in 2011. Provincial data show that higher levels of conflict were positively correlated with both a larger presence of troops (international and Afghan) and larger aid flows. Household data show that the negative impact of conflict on consumption was more than offset by the positive impact of aid and troops. According to the estimates, Afghan troops contributed more to poverty reduction than international troops, possibly because they spent more locally. The paper uses the estimated models to conduct an out-of-sample validation exercise, focusing on the transition initiated in 2014. The results should be interpreted with caution, as the quantitative models cannot account for strategic shifts in the insurgency and watershed political developments. But they suggest that the reduction in the number of international troops and declining foreign aid flows led to an increase in conflict intensity and a decline in consumption per capita, matching current trends.', 'last_modified_date': '2016-10-17T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Conflict and Development,Industry,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Poverty Reduction'}\n",

This paper uses data on exchange rates, foreign reserves and equity prices between April and August 2013 to analyze who was hit and why. It finds that emerging markets that allowed the real exchange rate to appreciate and the current account deficit to widen during the prior period of quantitative easing saw the sharpest impact. Better fundamentals (the budget deficit, the public debt, the level of reserves, or the rate of economic growth) did not provide insulation. A more important determinant of the differential impact was the size of the country's financial market: countries with larger markets experienced more pressure on the exchange rate, foreign reserves, and equity prices.

Over the last decade, many researchers and academics have tried to analyze the issue of MSME access to finance, emphasizing their dependence on credit and cash flows. This study presents a new approach to the estimation of the unmet demand for financing from MSMEs in developing countries. Importantly, it also describes the potential implications for the public-sector bodies, private sector financial institutions, and technology providers. The present research adds significant value to the repository of data in the MSME space, and opens new opportunities for further investigation. It estimates both supply of and demand for MSME finance on a global scale, which has never been done in a comprehensive way. This approach estimates MSME equilibrium lending in developed economies according to the industry, age, and size categories, and applies this benchmark to MSMEs in developing countries. It estimates the MSME finance gap as the difference between current supply and potential demand which can potentially be addressed by financial institutions. This report is divided into five sections. The first section reviews the literature about financing MSMEs. The second section describes the methodology of the present research, data sources, and the model specification. The third section analyzes the results of the finance gap estimation, including regional comparisons, formal, and informal MSME sector results, and gender disaggregated statistics.

The analysis finds that a great deal of caution is needed in using LLMs to annotate text as there is a risk of introducing biases that can lead to misleading inferences. Here this refers to bias in the technical sense, that the errors that LLMs make in annotating interview transcripts are not random with respect to the characteristics of the interview subjects. Training simpler supervised models on high-quality human annotations with flexible coding leads to less measurement error and bias than LLM annotations.

The authors investigate the cost-effectiveness of two methods for constructing mandatory individual accounts: a) Investing through the retail market with relatively open choice among investment companies (the method first used by Chile and adopted by most Latin American countries). b) Investing through the institutional market with constrained choice. For the retail market, they use data from mandatory pension funds in Chile and other Latin American countries and from voluntary mutual funds in the United States. For the institutional market, they use data from systems in Bolivia and Sweden and from larger pension plans and the federal Thrift Saving Plan in the United States. The institutional approaches aggregate numerous small accounts into large blocks of money and negotiate fees on a centralized basis, often through competitive bidding. They retain workers' choice o some funds. Fees and costs are kept low by reducing incentives for marketing, avoiding excess capacity at system start-up, and constraining choice to investment portfolio that are inexpensive to manage. In developed financial markets, the biggest potential cost saving stems from constrained portfolio choice, especially from a concentration on passive investment. The biggest cost saving for a given portfolio and for countries with weak financial markets comes from reduced marketing activities. In the retail market, where annualized fees and costs range from 0.8 percent to 1.5 percent of assets, use of the institutional market in individual retirement account systems has reduced those fees and costs to less than 0.2 percent to 0.6 percent of assets. This reduction can increase pensions by 10 - 20 percent relative to the retail market. Countries that can surmount rebidding problems, weaker performance incentives, inflexibility in the face of unforeseen contingencies, and an increased probability of corruption, collusion, and regulatory capture should seriously consider the institutional approach, especially at the start-up of a new multipillar system or for systems with small asset bases.\", 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'International Economics and Trade'}\n",

By 2050, with the urban population more than doubling its current size, nearly 7 of 10 people in the world will live in cities. Evidence from today's developed countries and rapidly emerging economies shows that urbanization and the development of cities is a source of dynamism that can lead to enhanced productivity. In fact, no country in the industrial age has ever achieved significant economic growth without urbanization. The underlying driver of this dynamism is the ability of cities to bring people together. Social and economic interactions are the hallmark of city life, making people more productive and often creating a vibrant market for innovations by entrepreneurs and investors. International evidence suggests that the elasticity of income per capita with respect to city population is between 3 percent and 8 percent (Rosenthal & Strange 2003). Each doubling of city size raises its productivity by 5 percent. But the coronavirus pandemic is now seriously limiting social interactions. With no vaccine available, prevention through containment and social distancing, along with frequent handwashing, appear to be, for now, the only viable strategies against the virus. The goal is to slow transmission and avoid overwhelming health systems that have finite resources. Hence non-essential businesses have been closed and social distancing measures, including lockdowns, are being applied in many countries. Will such measures defeat the virus in dense urban areas In principle, yes. Wealthier people in dense neighborhoods can isolate themselves while having amenities and groceries delivered to them. Many can connect remotely to work, and some can even afford to live without working for a time. But poorer residents of crowded neighborhoods cannot afford such luxuries. They are forced to leave their home every day to go to work, buy groceries, and do laundry.

Second, micro-credit also helps subsidy eligible households to overcome short-term liquidity constraints induced by the remuneration-post-verification subsidy design to invest in sanitation.

The analyses in this paper use data from Mexico's social security records and U.S. customs between the first quarter of 2007 and the last quarter of 2009 to identify four channels through which economic shocks emanating from the United States were amplified when transmitted into Mexico's offshoring labor market of Northern Mexico. First, employment and imports within industries are complements, which is consistent with imports being used as inputs for the assembly of exportable goods within industries. That is, when imports fell during the crisis, employment in Mexico was reduced rather than protected by the fall of imports. Second, contrary to other studies, employment is more responsive than wages to trade shocks. Third, fluctuations in Mexico-U.S. trade were associated with changes in the composition of employment, with the skill level of workers rising during downturns and falling during upswings. This implies that the correlation between average wages and trade shocks is partly driven by labor-force compositional effects, which may obscure individual-worker wage flexibility.

It uses household survey data collected prior to the crisis and simulates the impact of the growth slowdown. The simulations show that Latvia experienced a sharp rise in poverty, widening of the poverty gap, and a rise in income inequality due to the economic contraction in 2009. The 18 percent contraction in gross domestic product (affecting mainly trade hotels and restaurants, construction, and manufacturing) likely led the poverty head count to increase from 14.4 percent in 2008 to 20.2 percent in 2009. The poverty gap, which measures the national poverty deficit, was simulated to increase from 5.9 percent in 2008 to 8.3 percent in 2009. The analysis finds that the results are robust to most assumptions except post-layoff incomes, which substantially mitigated household welfare. The authors also simulate the impact of Latvia's Emergency Social Safety Net components and find that the Safety Net likely mitigated crisis impacts for many beneficiaries. The simulations measure only direct short-run impacts; hence, they do not take into account general equilibrium effects. Post-crisis income data from a different data source suggest that poverty rates increased by 8.0 percentage points between 2008 and 2009. As a result, the authors suggest that their ex-ante simulation performs reasonably well and is a useful tool to identify vulnerable groups during the early stages of a crisis.\", 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Social Protections and Labor,Poverty Reduction'}\n",

            "{'id': '699489', 'abstract': 'Several previous studies have asked whether environmental controls imposed in the industrial economies are diverting investments in pollution-intensive activities off-shore. Broadly, these studies conclude that direct investment does not appear to be stimulated by such regulations, partly because the cost of emission controls is generally a tiny fraction of operating costs. Yet direct investment reflects only part of what may be happening to world production patterns. Technology transfers may occur with no simultaneous direct investments, and production may readily shift toward a different global distribution without either direct investment or technology transfer. The authors attempt a general test of the displacement hypothesis, developing time series estimates of manufacturing pollution intensity for a large sample of developed and developing countries between 1960 and 1988. Among their conclusions: As a result of shifts in industrial composition, total manufacturing emissions relative to GDP grow faster than GDP at lower levels of per capita income and slower than GDP at higher levels of income. This happens because manufacturing has a declining share of GDP at higher income levels, not because of any shift toward a cleaner mix of manufacturing activities. The more rapidly growing high-income countries have actually enjoyed negative growth in toxic intensity of their manufacturing mix. Stricter regulation of pollution-intensive production in the OECD countries appears to have led to significant locational displacement, with consequent acceleration of industrial pollution intensity in developing countries. The poorest economies seem to have the highest growth in toxic intensity. One cannot, of course, be certain of the causal connection. Pollution intensity has grown most rapidly in developing economies that are relatively closed to world market forces. Relatively closed, fast-growing economies experienced rapid structural transitions toward greater toxic intensity. The opposite seems to have been true for more open economies.', 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Water Resources'}\n",

Their evaluation was based on new longitudinal data on PROBECAT trainees developed for this purpose, and includes data on a control group of unemployed people who did not join PROBECAT. Their main findings were as follows: On average, the trainees found jobs more quickly than the control group. But training does not shorten the term of unemployment for those without work experience. Male trainees are more likely to be employed three and six months after training than are the controls. Female trainees with work experience are more likely to be employed three, six, and twelve months after training than are the controls. Male trainees are more likely to find employment in large firms than are comparable controls. Training increases the monthly earnings of male trainees, but this effect varies systematically depending on the person's level of schooling attainment. The monetary benefits of training outweigh the costs of the PROBECAT program for certain groups of trainees. For male trainees over 25 with prior work experience, the benefits outweigh the costs of training within three months of starting work. For all other males except those with no prior work experience, the benefits outweigh the costs within one year. Men with no prior work experience spend the longest time job hunting after training (8 months, compared with the trainee mean of 4.4 months) and benefit less from training in terms of monthly earnings (128 thousand pesos compared with the average benefit of 152 thousand pesos).

Tariff data on agricultural and manufacturing goods are combined with household survey data on detailed income and expenditure patterns to estimate the first-order effects of the elimination of import tariffs on household welfare. The paper assesses how these welfare effects vary across the distribution by estimating impacts on the consumption of traded goods, wage income, farm and non-farm family enterprise income, and government transfers. For each country, the income gains and the inequality costs of trade liberalization are quantified and the trade-offs between them are assessed using an Atkinson social welfare index. The analysis finds average income gains from import tariff liberalization in 45 countries and average income losses in nine countries. Across countries in the sample, the gains from trade are 1.9 percent of real household expenditure on average. We find overwhelming evidence of a trade-off between the income gains (losses) and the inequality costs (gains), which arise because trade tends to exacerbate income inequality: 45 countries face a trade-off, while only nine do not. The income gains typically more than offset the increase in inequality.

Hence, it combines information on the intrinsic relatedness of a good with information on the local pattern of specialization. The results indicate that exports grow faster for goods that have denser links with those currently produced in the firm's locality. The density of links between products seems to yield export-enhancing spillovers.

The paper finds that indexes based on U.S. data do not provide a fair approximation of the levels, changes, and drivers of the routine cognitive and nonroutine manual skill content of jobs in developing countries. The paper also uncovers three new stylized facts. First, while developed countries tend to have jobs more intensive in nonroutine cognitive skills than developing countries, income (in growth and levels) is not associated with the skill content of jobs once the analysis accounts for other factors. Second, although adoption of information and communications technology is linked to job de-routinization, international trade is an offsetting force. Last, adoption of information and communications technology is correlated with lower employment growth in countries with a high share of occupations that are intensive in routine tasks.', 'last_modified_date': '2019-02-25T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Social Protections and Labor,Rural Development,Education'}\n",

Using firm registry data in Liberia, this study used the instrumental variable spatial autoregressive model to examine the effects of transport connectivity on firms' decisions on where to locate. The study found significant spatial autocorrelation and possible endogeneity related to transport infrastructure, and that firms are more likely to be located where market accessibility is better.

Many elements of the Singapore model are today considered conventional wisdom. While many developing countries have attempted to pursue similar strategies, few have fully succeeded in achieving similar results. This case study examines the policies, programs and processes Singapore has pursued from 1960 to the present to pull ahead of other economies. It identifies several factors that have undergirded Singapore’s successful implementation of education and health strategies. First, collecting and analyzing data to harness them for policymaking purposes. Second, able and incorruptible leaders who set high standards for themselves and others and have lived up to these standards. Third, Singapore created a meritocratic and largely non-politicized bureaucracy that could strategize, make far sighted policies, and implement them in a coordinated way. Coordinated implementation is key to delivering results. Fourth, national leadership-maintained harmony in a multi-ethnic society and proactively defused tensions. Fifth, Singapore attracted immigrants, both skilled and unskilled.

Within the collective bargaining framework, consumption decisions would be driven by the spouse with greater bargaining power, while the outcomes would still be Pareto efficient. Within the non-cooperative framework, households would not achieve Pareto efficient outcomes, and under the simplest representation, bargaining power would not affect consumption decisions. This paper develops a model that allows consumption patterns and labor supply to be affected by both bargaining power and non-cooperation. The model highlights the potential gains from improving bargaining power versus increasing cooperation between spouses, and presents conditions under which relatively large gains would be expected from moving to more equitable bargaining power versus achieving intra-household cooperation. The model's predictions are in turn tested using a unique panel data set on married couples in rural Malawi. The analysis shows that, relative to increasing wives' bargaining power, improving cooperation between spouses would exert larger and statistically significant positive impacts on total household income and consumption expenditures per capita, as well as the share of household consumption devoted to public goods. Supported also by cross-country qualitative research, the results suggest that household public goods are relatively important to both women and men in rural Malawi, husbands' capacity to control wives' incomes is relatively limited, and development programs that promote intra-household cooperation could lead to greater gains in income and household public goods provision compared with interventions focusing exclusively on women's empowerment.\", 'last_modified_date': '2020-05-19T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Social Protections and Labor,Education,Industry,Law and Development,Gender'}\n",

The results suggest that the returns to fertilizer are positive across the entire price range for beans, maize, and matooke and positive for the top 75 percent of prices for coffee. Commonly available improved seed varieties for maize and beans increase gains by 32 percent on average. However, accounting for the quality of the inputs available to farmers in the market, the sizeable positive returns become negative for most of the price distribution, possibly explaining the low adoption of inputs in Uganda. The paper also examines the impact of other factors that could affect input adoption, using a relatively long panel data set spanning 12 years.

UR Caribbean was organized by the World Bank’s Latin America and Caribbean Urban and Disaster Risk Management team and the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR), in partnership with the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency (CDEMA) and the European Union (EU); and was hosted by the Government of Barbados. This conference was co-financed by the European Union-funded Africa, Caribbean, Pacific – European Union (ACP-EU) Natural Disaster Risk Reduction (NDRR) Program, managed by GFDRR. Launched with a provocative opening speech from The Honorable Prime Minister of Barbados, Mia Mottley, the conference was rich with hard-hitting sessions, presentations and plenaries covering themes across the DRM spectrum, including risk analytics and communication, physical resilience, fiscal resilience, urban resilience, coastal protection, hydromet and early warning systems, community engagement, and emergency preparedness. Some sessions touched on drawing connections between disaster risk and medicine; utilizing nature to improve or replace man-made coastal defenses; engaging with the often-overlooked educational sector; and amplifying the voices of the youth.

Benchmarking the characteristics of these exporters with similar countries reveals that Argentine exporters are disproportionally fewer and individually larger, with export value extremely concentrated in a few firms. Firm churning rates are disproportionately low and survival rates of entrants are high.

This study looks at the experience in Bangladesh, India, Turkey, and Zimbabwe to see whether regulations make a difference in agriculture and input industries in developing economies. In all countries, companies and farmers responded to regulatory reforms by introducing and adopting more new technology and by expanding the production, trade, and use of inputs.

The paper characterizes the scope of products, as well as the levels of and changes to the trade values, market shares, volumes, and prices for those goods that eventually become subject to WTO litigation. The first result is striking heterogeneity in the level of market access at stake across disputes: for example, 14 percent of cases over disputed import products feature bilateral trade that is less than $1 million per year and another 15 percent feature bilateral trade that is more than $1 billion per year. Nevertheless, some strong patterns emerge from a more detailed examination of the data. Both high- and low-income complainants tend to suffer important losses in foreign market access in the products that ultimately become subject to dispute. Furthermore, although the respondent's imposition of an allegedly WTO-inconsistent policy is associated with reductions, on average, in trade values, volumes, and exporter-received prices, there is some evidence of differences in the size of these changes across the different types of policies under dispute and the potential exporter country litigants. Finally, these different types of policies under dispute can have dissimilar trade effects for the complainant relative to other (non-complainant) exporters of the disputed product and this is likely to affect the litigation allegiance of third countries.\", 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,International Economics and Trade'}\n",

Results of a labor productivity growth model for European countries suggest that improving the regulatory environment -- proxied by the Worldwide Governance Indicators regulatory quality indicator -- and boosting effective exposure to competition through increasing trade integration -- expressed as the ratio of exports plus imports to gross domestic product -- have positive effects on productivity growth. In Romania a 10 percent increase in openness to global trade over 1995-2010 would have boosted productivity growth by 9.7 percent per year. A 10 percent increase in openness to European Union trade, in particular, would have led to an annual increase in productivity of 7 percent. Realizing the benefits from trade integration depends to some extent on regulation. In this regard, the effects of regulation on productivity growth are found to be positive, regardless of the indicator used to measure regulation, and both through direct and indirect channels (by increasing the speed at which a country catches up with productivity leaders). Simulation results also show how countries with different levels of regulatory quality would benefit from a regulatory improvement: had Romania improved its regulatory environment to the same level as Denmark in 2010, its annual productivity growth would have been 14 percent higher over 1995-2010.', 'last_modified_date': '2013-06-20T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Environment,Transport,Private Sector Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Social Protections and Labor'}\n",

The aim was to provoke an open debate to obtain preliminary information on key issues for consideration in the Pacific Regional Energy Assessment. Discussed were key constraints on energy sector development: 1) Almost none of the countries has any known fossil fuel reserves -indigenous energy resources are mostly in the dispersed form of biomass and renewables. 2) The dispersion of the national territory of many countries into a large number of islands, separated by long distances, imposes heavy transport and communication costs. 3) The lack of purchasing power in the rural areas makes it difficult to recover the costs of rural electrification. 4) A high proportion of land is held under customary tenure, making it time-consuming and expensive to negotiate rights to use the land and to build access roads. 5) A high proportion of programs has been donor-driven and reflects the concerns of the agencies, rather than the real needs and priorities of the recipient countries. Major issues of concern include: 1) woodfuel availability; 2) agro-deforestation; 3) dependence on petroleum fuels; 4) the technical difficulty and high cost of installing rural electrification, and the economic and social inefficiency of subsidies; and 5) the institutional incapacity of the region's governments to address and resolve energy issues in an integrated and systematic manner. The report underscores the need for systematic data collection and analysis; existing surveys are inadequate. The report focuses on the integral involvement of women in using energy sources, and recommends that future approaches to rural electrification consider their role.

In particular, the study will test the three main hypotheses already presented in the literature by conducting rigorous econometric analysis using the large volume of microeconomic data available from the quarterly Labor Force Survey. The data are analyzed through a comprehensive econometric exercise using multivariate and probit regressions on unemployment status, earnings functions which control for individual and job characteristics, and by carrying out time series analysis of unemployment and wages between 1980-97. Chapters 1 and 2 provide background information on Sri Lanka's economic reforms and performance over the last decade, and summarize the conclusions of existing literature on unemployment there. Chapter 3 presents the new data and methodology used in this study, while Chapter 4 discusses the findings. Chapter 5 explains the results obtained from the data analysis from a broader public policy perspective, and Chapter 6 presents some reform options which could have positive impacts on the labor market.\", 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Health, Nutrition and Population'}\n",

It also indicates how the Bank and Fund are working to help respond to these challenges. A final section covers learning, capacity building, and outreach. The joint Review found general agreement on four key achievements of the PRSP approach to date: 1) a growing sense of ownership among most governments of their poverty reduction strategies; 2) a more open dialogue within governments, and with at least some parts of civil society, than had previously existed; 3) a more prominent place for poverty reduction in policy debates, extending beyond social sector interventions, to focus on reducing income poverty through higher, and more broadly shared growth; and, 4) more systematic data collection, analysis, and monitoring of outcomes. The key challenges identified during the joint Review include: alignment by partners, including the Bank and Fund, to support PRSP implementation; shifting beyond process, to content and implementation, and greater understanding of the linkages between policies, and poverty outcomes; and, realism in the setting of goals and targets.', 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Poverty Reduction'}\n",

The success of macroeconomic stabilization, typically in the hands of monetary policy, is not only determined by a suitable choice of the nominal anchor, which shapes the reaction function of monetary policy, but also the constraints within which the monetary policy strives to achieve its objectives. The key attributes of the constraints to macroeconomic stabilization are economic rigidities and structural shocks. By benchmarking the estimated economic rigidities and structural shocks faced by Macedonia to those faced by Slovakia, the authors find that Macedonia has relatively weaker transmission mechanisms of monetary policy, higher output rigidity, and a lower exchange rate pass-through, and faces larger external shocks. For Macedonia, these relatively higher constraints on monetary policy together with the chosen exchange rate anchor result in greater output and inflation volatility relative to Slovakia. Hence, it appears that small, open economies with stronger economic rigidities should apply monetary policy regimes that allow for more flexible adjustments in external relative prices to enhance their macroeconomic stability.', 'last_modified_date': '2008-08-13T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Finance and Financial Sector Development,Private Sector Development'}\n",

The same is true of benchmark comparisons as published by the United Nations, Eurostat, or OECD. But this expenditure-side interpretation of real GDP is quite different from the uses to which benchmark ICP and PWT data are frequently applied, such as in growth regressions, where \"real GDP\" is intended to reflect the production side of the economy. In this paper the authors propose a new approach to international comparisons of real GDP measured from the output side. They modify the traditional Gary-Khamis system, which measures real GDP from the expenditure side using real domestic expenditure, to include differences in the terms of trade between countries. The analysis shows that this system has a strictly positive solution under mild assumptions. On the basis of a set of domestic final output, import, and export prices and values for 151 countries in 1996, differences between real GDP measured from the expenditure and output side can be substantial, especially for small open economies.', 'last_modified_date': '2007-03-12T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,International Economics and Trade'}\n",

The seminar was held to identify and discuss the principal issues and options in the household and rural energy sector in the Pacific Island countries. The aim was to provoke an open debate to obtain preliminary information on key issues for consideration in the Pacific Regional Energy Assessment. Discussed were key constraints on energy sector development: 1) Almost none of the countries has any known fossil fuel reserves -indigenous energy resources are mostly in the dispersed form of biomass and renewables. 2) The dispersion of the national territory of many countries into a large number of islands, separated by long distances, imposes heavy transport and communication costs. 3) The lack of purchasing power in the rural areas makes it difficult to recover the costs of rural electrification. 4) A high proportion of land is held under customary tenure, making it time-consuming and expensive to negotiate rights to use the land and to build access roads. 5) A high proportion of programs has been donor-driven and reflects the concerns of the agencies, rather than the real needs and priorities of the recipient countries. Major issues of concern include: 1) woodfuel availability; 2) agro-deforestation; 3) dependence on petroleum fuels; 4) the technical difficulty and high cost of installing rural electrification, and the economic and social inefficiency of subsidies; and 5) the institutional incapacity of the region's governments to address and resolve energy issues in an integrated and systematic manner. The report underscores the need for systematic data collection and analysis; existing surveys are inadequate. The report focuses on the integral involvement of women in using energy sources, and recommends that future approaches to rural electrification consider their role.

Joint Monitoring Program (JMP) 2010 data indicate that around 38 percent of the rural population has access to improved sanitation services and that open defecation remains a widespread practice for over 60 million Indonesians. The persistence of old habits and a lack of awareness form the basis of many challenges in the Indonesian sanitation sector. To change this situation there is a need to focus on changing sanitation and hygiene behavior within communities, in addition to increasing investment in sanitation services. The majority of Indonesians are Muslims (88 percent), and Islamic teachings provide instruction and guidance on sanitation habits and behaviors. The teaching requires that running water, if available, should be used for anal cleansing and certain materials, including human excreta and urine, are regarded as najis (ritually unclean). Apart from the 'natural' feelings of disgust that most people express towards human excreta which result in anal cleansing, Islam requires ritual cleansing after being in contact with materials that are considered to be najis. However, the use of water for anal cleansing also appears to be a cultural habit as non-Muslim Indonesians also use water for anal cleansing, a fact confirmed by the study results.\", 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Water Resources,Health, Nutrition and Population'}\n",

In the periods 1959-1964 and 1969-1974, real wages declined despite relatively rapid rises in the overall demand for labor. An understanding of this trend is essential in devising labor market related policies for poverty redressal. First, it appears that macroeconomic and exchange rate policies will have important effects on real wages and therefore on poverty redressal and income distribution for a small open economy whose exports are land or natural resource intensive. For such economies, the exchange rate regime may have very different effects than conventionally anticipated. Second, the relevance and effectiveness of general labor raising policies will depend upon the extent to which labor demand raising impulses are transmitted from one part of the economy to the other parts. The degree of occupational mobility, the presence of manmade barriers to occupational entry, and the movements in various wage differentials over time are important signs to be noted.

Technological innovations in ironmaking and steelmaking have resulted in a rapidly increased demand for ore in processed form.

Import substituting developing economies was unable to harness imported machinery to reduce costs early in the period, but from about the early 1980s, with the opening of their trade regimes, they were able to benefit from the cost reducing effect. The results imply that innovative effort based on imported technologies can be a precursor to the development of domestic innovation capabilities.', 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Private Sector Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Finance and Financial Sector Development'}\n",
            "{'id': '699075', 'abstract': \"The 1990s brought developing countries the heaviest private capital flows since the early 1980s, says the author - mainly bond and equity financing, rather than medium- and long-term lending by commercial banks. Flows were mainly to Asia in the first half and Latin America in the second half. Market participants believe that most inflows of portfolio investment (especially in Latin America) reflected the return of flight capital by domestic residents with overseas holdings. This and possible herding by foreign investors in a few countries, such as Mexico, could at the margin make securities prices volatile in the emerging markets and cause rapid switching of portfolios between markets (between developed and emerging markets and between emerging markets). This could make macroeconomic management difficult for policymakers. Some contend that if external portfolio investment flows into an emerging market are the result of external factors - such as the U.S. recession and low international interest rates - the increased demand for shares in a relatively liquid emerging stock market may overheat the stock markets and lead to an appreciation of the real exchange rates in these countries. Any attempt to counteract this appreciation of the domestic currency by the monetary authorities, by devaluing the nominal exchange rate, will increase international reserves and perhaps be inflationary. If, on the other hand, policymakers dilute the effect of the real appreciation by sterilizing incoming resources through open market operations, this could increase domestic debt and possibly domestic interest rates. This might attract further inflows from abroad and create a vicious cycle of expected devaluations - which could further appreciate the domestic currency. What is crucial is the policymakers' perception of whether the inflows are temporary. That is why it is important to know the source of portfolio inflows. If the inflows are coming from investors with long-term capital appreciation motives, such as the large institutional investors, and the developing country remains on a path of sustained market-oriented reform aimed at long-run growth, these inflows should continue and even grow in the near future. As more comprehensive data become available, it is important to determine whether these inflows from abroad are intended to be short-term or long-term.

The authors propose that the quality of bureaucracy may be an important structural determinant of open economy macroeconomic policies - especially the imposition or removal of capital control. In their model, capital controls are an instrument of financial repression. They entail efficiency loss for the economy but also generate implicit revenue for the government. The results show that bureaucratic corruption translates into the government's reduced ability to collect tax revenues. Even if capital controls and financial repression are otherwise inefficient, the government still has to rely on them to raise revenues to provide public goods. Among the countries for which the authors could get relevant data, they find that the more corrupt ones are indeed more likely to impose capital controls, a pattern consistent with the model's prediction. To deal with possible reverse causality, they use the extent of corruption in a country's judicial system, and the degree of democracy, as the instrumental variables for bureaucratic corruption. The instrumental variable regressions show the same result: more corrupt countries are associated with more severe capital controls. The results suggest that as countries develop and improve their public institutions, reducing bureaucratic corruption over time, they will choose to gradually liberalize their capital accounts. Removing capital controls prematurely when forced by outside institutions to do so could reduce rather than improve their economic efficiency.\", 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Finance and Financial Sector Development'}\n",

The analysis in this paper is based on survey data collected before the program started (July 2012) and 15 months after the program ended (July 2014). The results of the impact evaluation show that the program has been successful in placing youths in paid jobs and has contributed to an increase of 15 percent in current employment among male participants. The evaluation also found that the program has had positive effects on wage earnings, especially those of females and among older males, with wages increasing by about K Sh 5,000 for males and by K Sh 7,500 for females. With a total unit cost of K Sh 97,000 per beneficiary, an estimated K Sh 6,768 monthly wage for males and K Sh 9,623 monthly wage for females, the program’s benefits exceeded the costs for males and females.

The study finds that extraction of wild resources (from natural forests, bushlands, fallows, etc.) provides on average as much income (about 27 percent) as crops across the smallholder sample. The cross-section data on past reactions to household self-perceived economic shocks and observed production reactions to climate anomalies can, respectively, provide hints about livelihood vulnerability to current climate variability, which is likely to worsen with climate change. Forest extraction did not figure among the most favored response strategies to households’ self-perceived economic shocks, but households undertake subtle substitutions in sector production in response to weather anomalies that accentuate suboptimal climatic conditions for cropping. By relying more on forest extraction and wages, households compensate quite successfully for declining crop incomes. This paints a cautiously optimistic picture about fairly flexible rural livelihood reactions to current climate variability, and featuring forests as potentially important in household coping strategies.', 'last_modified_date': '2015-11-09T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Science and Technology Development,Poverty Reduction,Energy,Environment,Health, Nutrition and Population'}\n",

The primary objectives were defined as(1) effecting a measurable improvement of waterquality passing out of the Nakivubo wetland into InnerMurchison Bay, (2) ensuring sustainable management ofthe Nakivubo wetland, (3) reducing water quality impactson human health and (4) opening up opportunitiesfor safe recreational use of the lower wetland.

Colombia now is seeking to join a free trade agreement (FTA) with the United States in the hope of stimulating growth and improving living conditions for the country as a whole. In response to the opportunities and challenges presented by the proposed FTA with the United States, the Colombian government has launched an \"internal agenda,\" an action plan that involves major stakeholders -- public sector, private sector, and regional government -- aimed at obtaining greater levels of competitiveness. The government has articulated the need for greater understanding of the impact of the proposed FTA, and a strategy for a reform agenda that would enable the country to capture the potential benefits from freer trade and facilitate the transition to greater openness. This report is produced as an input into Colombia\\'s reform agenda. It starts with an executive summary and policy report which presents the main findings and key policy recommendations of the three chapters comprising the report. Chapter 1 evaluates Colombia\\'s business and growth environment and the likely challenges the manufacturing sector will face in taking advantage of the FTA with the United States. The chapter consists of three sections. Section I uses detailed survey data to identify the top constraints on growth and competitiveness of Colombian firms. Section 2 analyzes key developments in the manufacturing sector following the trade liberalization of 1990-91 using micro-level data, and highlights areas where reforms are needed. Section 3 examines the challenges and opportunities faced by small and medium-sized businesses in confronting a more open trading environment. Chapter 2 builds on the microeconomic issues raised in the first chapter, and follows with an evaluation of macroeconomic and fiscal (tax and expenditure) policies that are important for making the Colombian economy competitive. In this context, the study also evaluates the sustainability and trajectory of public debt. Finally, Chapter 3 examines the likely impact of agricultural liberalization on income distribution in the country under the proposed Colombian-U.S. FTA -- identifying who are the likely gainers and losers -- and assesses its impact on economic growth and poverty in the country.', 'last_modified_date': '2019-05-05T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Law and Development,Public Sector Development,International Economics and Trade,Poverty Reduction'}\n",

The author finds that improving export practices would benefit the average Moldovan household across the whole income distribution. For example, halving informal export barriers would cause poverty to decline from 48.3 percent of the population to between 43.3 and 45.5 percent, potentially lifting 100,000-180,000 individuals out of poverty.', 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Health, Nutrition and Population'}\n",

While many governments around the world, including the Government of Indonesia, are interested in reforming and expanding their current teacher evaluation systems, often little is known about how principals, teachers, parents, and students perceive these evaluations. This paper uses data from a recent large-scale opinion survey in Indonesia to examine and provide rare insights into the attitudes of key education stakeholders towards teacher performance evaluations. Four key insights are identified. First, many principals and teachers agree with existing evaluation schemes employed in Indonesia, such as the teacher competence test (ujian kompetensi guru (UKG)) and the teacher performance evaluation (penilaian kinerja guru (PKG)) and are also open to reforms and the introduction of new schemes. Second, pay-for-performance schemes are generally popular among principals and teachers, and preferred over seniority-linked pay systems. Third, teachers in urban areas are more favorable towards pay-for-performance schemes than teachers in semi-urban areas.

It would take 30 minutes or more by foot to reach the nearest dilapidated bank branch, though most Alakudi residents have never bothered to make the trip. Within a short bicycle ride or walk along dirt lanes, all 2,000 households in Alakudi can reach a Kshetriya Gramin Financial Services (KGFS) branch. Each branch is painted in KGFS green and orange with an open front, rows of wooden benches, a teller window, two online computers, and three uniformed staff. But the villagers&#146; first contact with KFGS probably would not have happened at the branch. When the KGFS branch opened in Alakudi in September 2008, staff visited every household to conduct a village and household mapping exercise to demarcate the service area for the branch. They also invited villagers to come to the branch to enroll. As part of enrollment, staff completed a comprehensive know your customer (KYC) check, including a household visit, and compiled a household financial well-being report based on data provided by each household. This report established a household profile, specified financial goals, and formed the basis for KGFS staff to recommend a tailored portfolio of two to three financial products to meet each client&#146;s goals. KGFS staff visits each client&#146;s home every six months to update the report and give financial advice. Since KGFS arrived in Alakudi, 76 percent of all households have enrolled; of these, 89 percent have already begun to use some of the 15 financial products available at the branch.

Applying a difference-in-differences method, the econometric analyses yield the following conclusions. The expansion of global retail chains leads to a significant increase in the total factor productivity in the supplying industries. Their presence in a region increases the total factor productivity of firms in the supplying industries by 15.2 percent and doubling the number of chains leads to a 10.8 percent increase in total factor productivity. However, the expansion benefits larger firms the most and has a much smaller impact on small enterprises.

The informal sector thus makes consumption taxes progressive: households in the richest quintile face an effective tax rate that is twice that of the poorest quintile. The paper extends the standard optimal commodity tax model to allow for informal consumption and calibrates it to the data to study the effects of different tax policies on inequality. Contrary to consensus, the findings show that consumption taxes are redistributive, lowering inequality by as much as personal income taxes. These effects are primarily driven by the shape of the informality Engel curve.

Ambitious efforts are now being made to incorporate services in liberalization objectives of both sub-regional and regional integration efforts, including in the Asia-Pacific region under APEC and in the Western Hemisphere under the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) process. At the sub-regional level, member countries of both ASEAN (in East Asia) and MERCOSUR (in Latin America) have chosen to follow the liberalization model set forth in the World Trade Organization's (WTO) General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), and to open their services markets gradually and piecemeal. In the Western Hemisphere, Mexico has successfully promoted the NAFTA model of a more comprehensive liberalization of services markets - and several Latin American countries have adopted the same approach. Regionally, APEC has chosen a concerted voluntary approach to liberalizing services markets. Within the Western Hemisphere, participants are defining which approach they will use in the negotiations on services launched as part of the FTAA in April 1998. In all these efforts, a stated desire to promote more efficient services markets is often hindered by reluctance to open services markets rapidly or comprehensively because of historically entrenched protectionism in the sector and ignorance of the regulatory measures that impede trade in services. Presumably it would be easier to liberalize services at the sub-regional level, among countries at similar stages of development (although the liberalization's economic value there might be questioned). Liberalizing services at the broader regional level is a difficult and ambitious goal, given the diversity of countries involved in such efforts. Thus liberalization will probably move more slowly at the regional than at the sub-regional level - perhaps even more slowly than at the multilateral level. It is possible that the new round of multilateral talks on services scheduled to begin under the WTO in 2000 may well eclipse the recently begun regional efforts.\", 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Health, Nutrition and Population'}\n",

This paper assesses a central dimension of these agreements, the significance of tariff preferences, using a new data set on preferential and non-preferential or Most Favored Nation (MFN) applied tariffs, constructed by the International Trade Center and the World Bank. The data set covers 5,203 products, 199 reporters, and 239 partners, representing approximately 97 percent of world imports in 2016. There are three main findings. First, PTAs have significantly widened the scope of tariff-free trade. Whereas 42 percent of the total value of trade traded free under MFN rates in 2016, PTAs have fully liberalized an additional 28 percent of global trade. Second, the extent of preferential liberalization varies significantly across countries and sectors. Around 70 percent of countries have reduced trade-weighted average preferential tariffs to less than 5 percent, but PTAs have not been able to eliminate the high levels of protection in some low-income countries and in agricultural products, textiles, and footwear. Third, while the average preferential margin for trade covered by PTAs is low because one-fifth of world trade under preferential agreements is already duty free, more than a quarter of world trade is subject to an average preference margin of 7.4 percent. Considering competition from preferential and non-preferential sources, however, only 5.2 percent of global exports benefited from a preferential advantage of over 5 percent and only 3.3 percent of global exports suffered from a preferential disadvantage higher than 5 percent. Furthermore, data for a subsample of importers reveal that not all eligible imports take advantage of preferences, because of impediments such as restrictive rules of origin, and therefore actual preference margins are generally lower than potential margins.', 'last_modified_date': '2018-05-16T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Industry,International Economics and Trade,Transport,Energy,Water Resources'}\n",

Combining the two arguments, the author hypothesizes that as multilateral trade liberalization proceeds, and the number of regional integration arrangements increases, the ratio of free trade areas to customs unions also increases. The data, which show that ratio increasing in the 1990s, are consistent with the hypothesis.', 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'International Economics and Trade'}\n",

Surface drainage will maintain low water levels, and prevent water logging, and soil salinization. Given the focus of the project on drainage for agricultural land, it is not envisaged that involuntary resettlement would be required, nor does drainage endanger any archaeological, or historical site. However, during construction, potential adverse effects may occur, such as sludge drainage hampering domestic wastewater, in addition to noise, and air pollution. This Environmental Management Plan (EMP) provides mitigating measures as follows: 1) routine monitoring measures should be in place to maintain water quality standards; 2) selected areas should be monitored to minimize domestic, and industrial wastewater discharges into open drains; 3) project design includes a specific environmental review of all project related works, and actions, to minimize potential environmental impacts. The EMP particularly focuses on those subproject locations, located in vulnerable areas, such as coastal, reclaimed deserts, and seriously polluted drains, emphasizing compliance with environmental guidelines, and enforcement of regulatory framework, as needed.', 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Water Resources'}\n",

Through a disaggregated analysis of coverage, absorption, and dropout data in secondary education at the state level, the study categorizes states according to the stage in the educational cycle at which dropout primarily occurs. The study further examines the academic, social, and economic consequences of dropout through an analysis of employment and youth survey data. The analysis of factors associated with dropout uses self-reported factors as well as estimated probit models that use household data from national surveys and the national standardized test. The central conclusion reached is that in addition to the patterns of dropout found, multiple elements intersect with the patterns to form a complex panorama. Key findings include: i) personal, family, and household economic factors and the prevalence of social risks have a closer association with dropout earlier in the education cycle; ii) the association between dropout and the quality of education has greater intensity in states where dropout occurs primarily during upper secondary education and in those with the lowest upper secondary dropout rates; and iii) as the returns to education grow, dropout is lower; in the case of returns to higher education, the association with dropout is stronger for states that have the highest dropout during upper secondary education.

Without rapid adaptation, climate change will increase the burden of heat stress experienced by much of the world’s population in the coming decades. What will the distributional consequences of this added heat stress be, and how might this affect optimal climate policy Using detailed survey data of household wealth in 690,745 households across 52 countries, this paper finds evidence suggesting that the welfare impacts of added heat stress caused by climate change may be regressive. Specifically, the analysis finds that poorer households tend to be located in hotter locations across and within countries, and poorer individuals are more likely to work in occupations with greater exposure to the elements not only across but also within countries. These findings—combined with the fact that current social cost of carbon estimates do not include climate damages arising from the productivity impacts of heat stress—suggest that optimal climate policy, especially when allowing for declining marginal utility of consumption, involves more stringent abatement than currently suggested, and that redistributive adaptation policies may be required to reduce the mechanical inequities in welfare impacts arising from climate change.', 'last_modified_date': '2015-11-09T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Industry,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Science and Technology Development,Health, Nutrition and Population,Environment,Social Protections and Labor,Poverty Reduction'}\n",

The paper presents the Long-Term Growth Model Public Capital Extension (LTGM-PC) and accompanying freely downloadable Excel-based tool. It also constructs a new Infrastructure Efficiency Index (IEI), by combining quality indicators for power, roads, and water as a cardinal measure of the quality of public capital in each country. In the model, public investment generates a larger boost to growth if existing stocks of public capital are low, or if public capital is particularly important in the production function. Through the lens of the model and utilizing newly-collated cross-country data, the paper presents three stylized facts and some related policy implications. First, the measured public capital stock is roughly constant as a share of gross domestic product (GDP) across income groups, which implies that the returns to new public investment, and its effect on growth, are roughly constant across development levels. Second, developing countries are relatively short of private capital, which means that private investment provides the largest boost to growth in low-income countries. Third, low-income countries have the lowest quality of public capital and the lowest efficient public capital stock as a share of gross domestic product. Although this does not affect the returns to public investment, it means that improving the efficiency of public investment has a sizable effect on growth in low-income countries. Quantitatively, a permanent 1ppt GDP increase in public investment boosts growth by around 0.1-0.2ppts over the following few years (depending on the parameters), with the effect declining over time.', 'last_modified_date': '2018-10-09T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Energy,Water Resources,Infrastructure Economics and Finance,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Law and Development'}\n",

Data from the 2015 survey are compared with data from a similar survey in 2007 to identify trends over time. The study examines current policies to promote U-I collaboration in Sri Lanka, highlights some good practices in other countries, and suggests possible ways that Sri Lanka may be able to strengthen U-I collaboration. The report is intended primarily for policy makers in the fields of higher education, research, and innovation, as well as for researchers in companies, universities, and research institutes who are already collaborating in public-private partnerships or are planning to do so. The responses show that the majority of existing links between Sri Lankan universities and companies are short-term, informal interactions with low direct transfer of knowledge and innovation. However, the survey findings also show a growing emphasis on deeper and more demanding types of collaboration, such as joint Research and Development activities, prototype testing, and spin-offs, even though these remain relatively uncommon. Key recommendations to strengthen U-I collaboration are: As part of the national Science, Technology, and Innovation Policy 2016-2020, develop and implement a national plan to upgrade the country’s research infrastructure, in line with national research and innovation priorities.

It relies on a unique longitudinal dataset consisting of administrative records and social security data for the universe of refugees in Switzerland over 1998–2018. This data is used to reconstruct the individual-level trajectories of refugees and to follow them since arrival over the life-cycle. The study documents the patterns of labor-market integration, and highlights the heterogeneity by gender and age at arrival. Refugees’ labor-market performance is compared to natives’ and other groups of migrants’ labor-market performance. The empirical analysis exploits the government dispersal policy in place since 1998, which consists of the random allocation of refugees across cantons, to identify the causal effects of the local initial conditions. The study finds that higher unemployment rates at arrival slow down the integration process, whereas the existence of a co-ethnic network does not consistently lead to a faster integration. It is shown that in locations where refugees face relatively more hostile attitudes by natives upon arrival, they integrate at a faster pace, probably due to a greater effort undertaken in environments that are more hostile.

As a result, the banking correspondent (BC), or doorstep banking model was introduced in India to bring basic banking services to rural people. Clients of BC programs include mainly house-holds with very low incomes and poor access to the formal banking system. This paper explores the uptake of branchless banking in one of the largest BC programs in the world, Financial Inclusion Network and Operations (FINO), which currently has over 48 million activated savings accounts across India. Despite being open, many savings accounts have remained dormant, thus raising the question of whether access alone can result in real financial inclusion. In this paper, the authors present the results of a randomized financial literacy training program offered to FINO clients on the transaction activities in their (no-frills) savings account. About 3000 clients, in two districts of the state of Uttar Pradesh, were randomly assigned to a control and a treatment groups out of whom 1500 treatment clients received two-day financial literacy training. Using the historical transaction data from savings account, the authors estimate the short run impacts of the financial literacy training on account usage. Overall, the results suggest that financial education can in-crease usage of no-frills savings accounts and consequently can go a long way in improving financial inclusion for the poor. Given FINO's mandate to expand access and use of financial services to the poor, effective financial literacy training, coupled with adequate incentives for the Bandhus, have the potential to influence savings behaviors, and hence, improve the financial welfare of low income families. The paper is organized as follows: section one gives introduction. Section two outlines the FINO program and why it presents a unique opportunity to study the intersection of financial literacy and financial access.

Planners could control imports through these corporations so there was little need for conventional instruments such as tariffs, quotas, and licenses. Trade reforms increased the range of enterprises eligible to trade in specific commodities and led to the development of indirect new trade instruments, such as duty exemptions. Duty exemptions almost completely liberalized the imports of intermediate inputs used to produce exports and investment goods used in joint ventures with foreign enterprises. Comprehensive liberalization measures in China's World Trade Organization (WTO) accession package will help ease this problem as tariff reduction reduces the costs of domestic inputs to exporters. WTO commitments will also lead to the abolition of most nontariff barriers and of quotas on textiles and clothing. With accession, China's share of world exports may almost double between 1995 and 2005 - an estimate that is smaller than those found in studies that do not incorporate duty exemptions.

To address the deep historical roots of inequality in Latin America, and the powerful contemporary economic, political and social mechanisms that sustain it, Inequality in Latin America and the Caribbean outlines four broad areas for action by governments and civil society groups to break this destructive pattern: 1) Build more open political and social institutions, that allow the poor and historically subordinate groups to gain a greater share of agency, voice and power in society. 2) Ensure that economic institutions and policies seek greater equity, through sound macroeconomic management and equitable, efficient crisis resolution institutions, that avoid the large regressive redistributions that occur during crises, and that allow for saving in good times to enhance access by the poor to social safety nets in bad times. 3) Increase access by the poor to high-quality public services, especially education, health, water and electricity, as well as access to farmland and the rural services. Protect and enforce the property rights of the urban poor. 4) Reform income transfer programs so that they reach the poorest families.', 'last_modified_date': '2019-05-06T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Environment,Governance,Poverty Reduction'}\n",

This sum is the equivalent of US$5 per person in Tanzania per year or 1percent of the national Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The costs of poor sanitation are inequitably distributed with the highest economic burden falling disproportionately on the poorest. The average cost associated with poor sanitation, constitutes a much greater proportion of a poor person's income than that of a wealthier person. This study provides an estimation of economic impacts on populations without access to improved sanitation in order to provide information on the losses to society of the current sanitation situation. While not all these economic impacts can be immediately recovered from improved sanitation practices, it provides a perspective on the economic gains that are available to countries through a range of policies to mitigate these impacts over the longer term. Underlying data sets to estimate economic impacts are weak; the study therefore uses objectively verified data sources and conservative numbers to estimate economic impacts. Several impacts have been excluded due to lack of data. Therefore the total costs of poor sanitation in this report are likely to be a significant underestimate.\", 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Transport,Health, Nutrition and Population,Water Supply and Sanitation'}\n",

A decomposition methodology allows a comparison of imports from two groups of countries supplying the same product: those that are named in the petition and those that are not. The same decomposition can be applied to products quite similar to the imports in question, but not subject to a petition. The results suggest that industries typically seek protection when faced with a specific pattern of shocks. First, a persistent positive relative supply shock favors imports from named countries. Second, a negative demand shock hits imports from all sources just prior to domestic industries' petition for protection. The relative supply shock is a broad one; it applies both to named commodities and to the comparison product group. The import demand shock, by contrast, is narrow, hitting only named products. The latter shock is also large: import growth over the two-year window is 15 percentage points lower in named products than in reference products, with most of this gap arising in the final two quarters before the petition. The negative import demand shock appears to be a key event in the run-up to the filing of a petition.

Increasing longevity combined with low fertility and emigration have made Bulgaria’s age structure increasingly top-heavy and its dependency ratios higher. At the same time, the economic sectors that absorbed low-skilled workers during the high-growth early 2000s, such as construction and manufacturing, were those that contracted most during the 2008–09 economic crisis and they have not yet recovered. Meanwhile, activities demanding high-skilled labor, such as financial and business services and information, communication, and technology (ICT), have been faring relatively well. This study uses a new dataset with direct measures of cognitive and socio-emotional skills to examine the relationship between skills and labor market outcomes in Bulgaria. For a long time, labor market studies had to rely on formal educational attainment as a measure of an individual’s skills. However, the correlation between formal education and skills is not perfect, and not all diplomas are equal in terms of imparting certain skills to students. Moreover, valuable skills can be acquired without formal diplomas, for example through on-the-job training or learning-by doing. In addition to using educational attainment this study therefore looks at direct measures of two types of skills that employer’s value: cognitive skills, such as functional literacy and numeracy, and socio-emotional skills, such as self-discipline, perseverance, and ability to work well with others. The objective is to assess the extent to which these direct measures shed light on what matters for labor market success, defined as being in the labor force, being employed, and earning more. This analysis relies on original data (the Bulgarian Longitudinal Inclusive Society Survey, BLISS) collected by the World Bank and Open Society Institute–Sofia in the spring of 2013, which for the first time in the country included nationally-representative information on the cognitive and socio-emotional skills of the working-age population.', 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Public Sector Development,Governance,Social Protections and Labor'}\n",

In the same year, as a percentage of total government expenditure, Lebanon spent 7.2 percent on education. An important challenge for Lebanon is that its best-trained people migrate abroad or have to face low rates of return to schooling domestically. Lebanon is experiencing an over-supply of teachers, which provides an opportunity to be more selective and raise the bar for entering teachers. While some neighboring countries only screen teacher candidates based on test scores in the secondary school leaving examination (West Bank & Gaza, Jordan, and Yemen), applicants for teacher education programs in Lebanon are admitted based on two criteria: (i) test scores in the secondary school leaving examination, and (ii) performance in the compulsory entrance examination for teacher education programs. While there are some mechanisms in place to hold teachers accountable, their enforceability is limited. Teachers are offered few financial incentives or opportunities for public recognition to reward strong performance. There is no probationary period prior to awarding open-ended status. While the first years of teaching are among the best available predictors of a teacher's performance later on in their career, Lebanon does not use this period to weed out the lowest-performing teachers. Once a teacher has an open-ended appointment, weak results in the performance evaluation process may not be used to dismiss ineffective teachers. In fact, based on the evaluation process, it appears to be difficult to identify low-performers and high performers. Lebanon may look to the experience of other countries in setting policies to remove chronically low-performing teachers. The benefits of doing so are twofold: first, such mechanisms protect students from the detrimental and lasting effects of having poor teachers; and second, they can give teachers a clear incentive to work hard in order to avoid them.\", 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Education'}\n",

The analysis uses data from the Adolescent Girls Initiative endline survey and the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data to measure conflict exposure using constructed cluster-level, self-reported, and external conflict exposure variables. The impact of conflict exposure is then estimated on a set of socioeconomic outcomes of adolescent girls by comparing exposed and non-exposed clusters before and after the conflict. The results suggest that girls from clusters more affected by the conflict had statistically different outcomes compared with girls from less affected clusters. Specifically, there is strong evidence that the conflict negatively affected outcomes related to income opportunities, aspirations, marriage, and household characteristics, but increased self-reported empowerment and entrepreneurial potential scores. The results indicate that impacts on labor supply, personal motivation, household conditions, and other forms of victimization are important channels through which conflict negatively impacts adolescent girls.', 'last_modified_date': '2018-07-10T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Social Development,Conflict and Development,Education,Poverty Reduction'}\n",

It designs and conduct a novel survey to collect program-level information on quality determinants and average outcomes for Brazil, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, and Peru. Categories of quality determinants include training and curriculum, infrastructure, faculty, link with productive sector, costs and funding, and practices on student admission and institutional governance. The paper also collects administrative, student-level data on higher education and formal employment for SCP students in Brazil and Ecuador and match it to survey data. Machine learning methods are used to select the quality determinants that predict outcomes at the program and student levels. Estimates indicate that some quality determinants may favor academic and labor market outcomes while others may hinder them. Two practices predict improvements in all labor market outcomes in Brazil and Ecuador—teaching numerical competencies and providing job market information—and one practice—teaching numerical competencies—additionally predicts improvements in labor market outcomes for all survey countries. Since quality determinants account for 20-40 percent of the explained variation in student-level outcomes, quality determinants might have a role shrinking program quality gaps.

The analysis finds that contractual friction distorts countries' trade pattern beyond its effect on domestic production structure, by deterring the probability of exporting (the extensive margin) and export sales after entry (the intensive margin), particularly in industries that rely more heavily on relationship-specific inputs (more vulnerable to holdup problems). The analysis also finds that contractual frictions matter more for the intensive margin than the extensive margin of exporting. In addition, better contracting institutions increase the probability of survival of new export products in more contract-intensive industries.

The suggestion from the combined National Sample Survey and Palanpur data is of a slow process of non-farm diversification, whose distributional incidence, on the margin, is increasingly pro-poor. The village-level analysis documents that the non-farm sector is not only increasing incomes and reducing poverty, but appears as well to be breaking down long-standing barriers to mobility among the poorest segments of rural society. Efforts by the government of India to accelerate the process of diversification could thus yield significant returns in terms of declining poverty and increased income mobility. The evidence from Palanpur also shows, however, that at the village-level a significant increase in income inequality has accompanied diversification away from the farm. A growing literature argues that such a rise in inequality could affect the fabric of village society, the way in which village institutions function and evolve, and the scope for collective action at the village level.

Despite this intuitive appeal, there is little empirical evidence on the positive effect of financial liberalization on capital allocation. The main difficulty of investigating the linkage between liberalization of financial markets and capital allocation efficiency lies in the fact that the efficiency of capital allocation is not directly observable. One way to address this issue is to evaluate the effect of financial liberalization within the Heckscher-Ohlin framework. Producing and exporting products inconsistent with a country's factor endowments constitutes a serious misallocation of the funds, which undermines competitiveness of the economy and inhibits its long run growth. This paper tests the allocative efficiency hypothesis by evaluating the effect of stock market liberalization on the survival of different product categories using export data for 91 countries over the period of 1975-2003.

This paper looks at the effects at two levels: top-down elite driven reforms at the national level; and inside-outside, bottom-up reforms at local levels which leverage the heterogeneity of institutions in India's federal system, across both states and sectors, to ally with forward-looking segments of entrenched interests and gradually expand and provide prototypes for others to mimic, replicate and improve. The paper concludes that in the last decade, the travails of the Indian state, together with an economic boom in India, have led to an increase in returnees but this time the locus of their activities has shifted from the state to the private sector and social entrepreneurship, reflecting both a weakness of the Indian state but also its inability to leverage such a reservoir of talent. Given India's chaotic democracy and weak institutions, but open society, there are numerous opportunities for returning talent to foment change.

This first phase of ALMP reforms has been initiated with a pilot program in three municipalities (Elefsina, Asporpyrgos, and Mandra) covered by the local office of the Greek Manpower Employment Organization (OAED) in Elefsina and targeting those aged 45 and over registered unemployed for at least 6 months. The World Bank has been providing technical assistance to the Ministry of Labor, Social Security and Social Solidarity (MoLSSSS) and OAED to define the key design and operational parameters for implementing the pilot program and to support the gradual roll-out of three reformed programs, including a demand-responsive training program (DRTP). The DRTP is a voucher program, which, after profiling of eligible unemployed people, counseling including referrals, and assessment of prior learning, will include on and off the job training, certification of skills gained, and potentially, bonus payments to training providers based on job outcomes for trainees. OAED will be responsible for the implementation and monitoring of the program.The purpose of this document is to provide functional and technical specifications for a management information system (MIS) to underpin the DRTP during the pilot phase (DRTP MIS). The MIS that is put in place for the pilot should be capable of supporting training programs beyond the pilot that are consistent with an open framework approach where jobseekers are offered personalized services through OAED, including referrals to a training program (or other ALMPs) and training programs are available on a continuous basis. The World Bank team supports this decision based on a review of existing and potential infrastructure and information systems, as the voucher platform already provides a large part of the functionality needed for the DRTP MIS and has the potential to become a strong basis for the development of a more sophisticated MIS for the management, monitoring and evaluation of DRTPs in the future, through the realization of gradual improvements, such as for example provision of advanced communication mechanisms between beneficiaries, training providers and firms; integration with the counseling IT infrastructure of OAED; open application submission for training providers; advanced monitoring and evaluation mechanisms for both beneficiaries and training programs, etc.', 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Information and Communication Technologies,Rural Development,Social Protections and Labor'}\n",

At the same time, evidence on the effectiveness of at-scale behavior change interventions to improve sanitation and hygiene practices is limited. This paper presents the results of two large-scale, government-led handwashing and sanitation promotion campaigns in rural Tanzania. For the campaign, 181 wards were randomly assigned to receive sanitation promotion, handwashing promotion, both interventions together, or neither. One year after the end of the program, sanitation wards increased latrine construction rates from 38.6 to 51 percent and reduced regular open defecation from 23.1 to 11.1 percent. Households in handwashing wards show marginal improvements in handwashing behavior related to food preparation, but not at other critical junctures. Limited interaction is observed between handwashing and sanitation on intermediate outcomes: wards that received both handwashing and sanitation promotion are less likely to have feces visible around their latrine and more likely to have a handwashing station close to their latrine facility relative to individual treatment groups. Final health effects on child health measured through diarrhea, anemia, stunting, and wasting are absent in the single-intervention groups. The combined-treatment group produces statistically detectable, but biologically insignificant and inconsistent, health impacts. The results highlight the importance of focusing on intermediate outcomes of take-up and behavior change as a critical first step in large-scale programs before realizing the changes in health that sanitation and hygiene interventions aim to deliver.', 'last_modified_date': '2015-01-15T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'N/A'}\n",

The analysis uses data from the Adolescent Girls Initiative end line survey and the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data to measure conflict exposure using constructed cluster-level, self-reported, and external conflict exposure variables. The impact of conflict exposure is then estimated on a set of socioeconomic outcomes of adolescent girls by comparing exposed and non-exposed clusters before and after the conflict. The results suggest that girls from clusters more affected by the conflict had statistically different outcomes compared with girls from less affected clusters. Specifically, there is strong evidence that the conflict negatively affected outcomes related to income opportunities, aspirations, marriage, and household characteristics, but increased self-reported empowerment and entrepreneurial potential scores.

It was first published in 2008, applied to Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). The findings were eye-opening: behind the enormous inequality that characterizes the region's distribution of development outcomes (income, land ownership and educational attainment, among others), there is an even more worrying inequality of development opportunities. It is not only rewards that are unequal; it is also chances. The problem is not just about equality; it is about equity too. The playing field is uneven from the start. This book reports on the status and evolution of human opportunity in LAC. It builds on the 2008 publication in several directions. First, it uses newly-available data to expand the set of opportunities and personal circumstances under analysis. The data is representative of some 200 million children living in 19 countries over the last 15 years. Second, it compares human opportunity in LAC with that of developed countries, among them the US and France, two very different models of social policy. This allows for illuminating exercises in benchmarking and extrapolation. And third, it looks at human opportunity within countries across regions, states and cities. This gives us a preliminary glimpse at the geographic dimension of equity, and at the role that different federal structures play. The overall message that emerges is one of cautious hope. LAC is making progress in opening the doors of development to all. But it still has a long way to go. At the current pace, it would take, on average, a generation for the region to achieve universal access to just the basic services that make for human opportunity.

They do not capture how far behind malnourished children are relative to the World Health Organization growth standards. To understand the severity of malnutrition, this study develops a new malnutrition measurement, using the method originally developed for estimating poverty. This study estimates the prevalence, gap, and gap squared for stunting, wasting, overweight, and underweight, using data from 94 developing countries over 20 years. The results show that although in most cases the headcount measures and gap measures are moving in the same direction, in many other cases, they are moving in opposite directions. Moreover, employing the new measures, the study can identify countries that have low levels of headcount for a malnutrition measure but comparatively high severity of malnutrition according to the gap measures, and vice versa. This suggests that these new malnutrition measures provide additional information on the severity of malnutrition that is not possible to be known from headcount measures. These new measures of the severity of malnutrition can therefore improve the monitoring of child malnutrition across countries, and consequently help countries to achieve their Sustainable Development Goals.', 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Health, Nutrition and Population,Poverty Reduction,Social Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth'}\n",

Personal income tax multipliers are slightly higher, ranging from 1.4 to 2.3. While income taxes reduce employment, environmental taxes do not. Environmental tax multipliers are highly regime dependent: they are close to zero or statistically insignificant unless taxes are increased when output contracts, fuel prices are high, the environmental tax levels are high, or the carbon intensity of output is low.

The data cover six areas of law, ad-dressed by six indicators: (a) access to institutions, (b) access to education, (c) access to the labor market, (d) access to property, (e) access to public services and social protection, and (f) protection from hate crimes and hate speech. The laws, policies, and regulations presented fall under one of these indicators. For each, the paper attempts to identify the minority gap, the difference between the legal treatment of the ruling majority and that of the minority. Data were collected through two sources: first, standardized surveys submitted to ombudsman institutions, lawyers, academics, and civil society organizations; second, public government records on laws and regulations and data from international legal databases and human rights organizations. The idea driving the study is that institutional measures that hamper the access of ethnic, religious, and sexual minorities to the labor market and financial systems directly affect their economic performance and, as a consequence, represent a cost for the economy. Among the findings of the study is that antidiscrimination labor legislation is well developed in all six pilot economies, but many gaps still exist in access to property and in access to public goods and social services. The study also found that, of the three groups covered by the study, the least protected under the law are the sexual minorities. Although data from six economies cannot provide statistical evidence, findings suggest the need for further research.

To answer these questions, the paper uses quarterly data covering 96 countries and identifies 272 recovery episodes. It finds that more than 25 percent of all recoveries are credit-less and around 45 percent of all credit-less recoveries occurred in 2009-10. It also finds that output and investment growth tends to be lower in credit-less events but, by eight quarters after the trough date, the gap between credit-less and credit-with episodes is mostly exhausted. Results of the probit estimations show that the size of the downturn and the extent of external adjustment are associated with the likelihood of credit-less recoveries. Moreover, fiscal loosening tends to be related to credit-less events while monetary easing and a country's decision to seek an International Monetary Fund-supported program reduce the probability of credit-less recoveries. Finally, the model suggests that many countries in the Europe and Central Asia region were likely to experience credit-less recoveries following the global financial crisis in 2008/09. What is more worrisome for them is the fact that they are facing another negative external shock.\", 'last_modified_date': '2013-05-24T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Finance and Financial Sector Development'}\n",

Several studies have shown that stunted growth during childhood entraps the future of children in a vicious circle of recurrent diseases, reduced human development, and lower earnings, thus increasing their likelihood of being poor when they grow up. To reduce stunting, the Government of Tanzania and development partners are introducing a convergence of multisectoral interventions adapted to local needs. However, the existing stunting data are representative only at higher administrative levels, thus making it difficult to implement these efforts. The paper uses the 2016 geo-referenced Demographic and Health Survey in conjunction with relevant spatially gridded covariate data, such as nighttime lights, water and sanitation access, vegetation index, travel time, and so on. Geospatial techniques, such as model-based statistics and Bayesian inference implemented using the INLA algorithm, along with appropriate model validation exercises are employed to develop high-resolution maps of stunting in Tanzania at 1×1-kilometer spatial resolution. The maps show that areas of consistently high stunting rates tend to be more common in rural parts of the country, especially throughout the western and southwestern border areas.

Policy practitioners usually examine real exchange rate misalignments to monitor the behavior of this key relative price and, if possible, exploit distortions in the traded and non-traded relative price to promote growth. Anecdotal evidence shows that some countries have pursued very active exchange rate policies to promote the export sector and enhance growth by undervaluing their currencies. The main goal of this paper is to provide a systematic characterization of real exchange rate undervaluations. The long-run real exchange rate equation is estimated using: (a) Johansen time series cointegration estimates, and (b) pooled mean group estimates for non-stationary panel data. The paper constructs a dataset of real undervaluation episodes. It first evaluates whether (and if so, to what extent) economic policies can be used to either cause or sustain real undervaluations. In this context the paper empirically models the likelihood and magnitude of sustaining real exchange rate undervaluations by examining their link to policy instruments (such as exchange rate regimes and capital controls, among other policies) using probit and Tobit models. Finally, it investigates whether foreign exchange intervention can generate persistent real exchange rate deviations from equilibrium.

The informal status of many firms substantially reduces the tax basis and therefore impacts the provision of public goods. The literature on encouraging formalization has predominantly focused on reducing the direct costs of formalization and has found negligible impacts of such policies. This paper focuses on a stick intervention, which to the best of the knowledge of the authors is the first one in a developing country setting that deals with the most direct and dominant form of informality, i.e. registration with the tax authority with a direct link to the country's potential revenue base and thus public goods provision. The paper implements an experiment in which firms are visited by tax representatives who deliver an official letter from the Bangladesh National Tax Authority stating that the firm is not registered and the consequential punishment if the firm fails to register. The paper finds that the intervention increases the rate of registration among treated firms, while firms located in the same market but not treated do not seem to respond significantly. The paper also finds that only larger revenue firms at baseline respond to the threat and register. These findings have at least two important policy implications: i. the enforcement angle, which could be an important tool to encourage formalization; and ii. targeting of government resources for formalization to the high-end informal firms. The effects are generally small in levels and this leaves open the question of why many firms still do not register.\", 'last_modified_date': '2015-06-26T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Private Sector Development,Law and Development'}\n",

Economies are ranked on their ease of doing business; for 2015 Ukraine ranks 96. A high ease of doing business ranking means the regulatory environment is more conducive to the starting and operation of a local firm. Doing Business presents quantitative indicators on business regulations and the protection of property rights that can be compared across 189 economies from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe and over time. Doing Business measures regulations affecting 11 areas of the life of a business known as indicators. Ten of these areas are included in this year's ranking on the ease of doing business: starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts, and resolving insolvency. Doing Business also measures labor market regulation, which is not included in this year's ranking. The data in this report are current as of June 1, 2014 (except for the paying taxes indicators, which cover the period from January to December 2013).\", 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Finance and Financial Sector Development,Rural Development,Private Sector Development,Law and Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Social Protections and Labor'}\n",

Implementation of trade reform overall, however (but not the most important reforms), has been better in sub-Saharan Africa. Retrogression has also been more frequent. As a group, the intensive adjustment lending countries made significant progress in the 1980s and early 1990s, but there was significant variation among them. For sub-Saharan Africa, progress has been more impressive in recent years then in earlier years. In many countries, adjustment did not begin until the mid-1980s and relatively few measures were implemented up front. For the franc-zone countries, underimplementation rates are lower in the most recent data, and by some - but not all - measures their openness has improved more in recent years. By virtually all measures, however, improvements over earlier periods have not been as great for non-franc zone countries. Reduced protection was largely offset by real devaluation in most country groups and, by most measures, incentives to produce import substitutes actually improved in the years immediately after the first adjustment loan. In more recent years, the incentives have fallen modestly. Using a new method for quantifying nontariff protection in terms of tariff equivalence, the author argues that, in general, countries are not in danger of de-industrialization from the rapid disprotection of import-substituting industry. However, franc-zone countries showed greater declines in incentives for import substitution because of their lower rate of real devaluation. One implication may be that their ability to reduce tariffs and nontariff barriers is impeded by their inability to offset them with devaluations as other countries did. Non-franc-zone countries reduced tariff-equivilant protection in recent years by 15 to 49 percentage points more than franc-zone countries. How open are the trade regimes at this point? The decline in tariff-equivalent protection, although not trivial, is insufficient to reduce the protection to moderate levels relative to deep reformers in East Asia and Latin America. The biggest problem is with foreign exchange allocation. Mauritius may be the only non-franc zone sub-Saharan country in which the currency is essentially convertible and has been for some time. This basic reform has not begun in most countries or has only recently been completed (Ghana).', 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'International Economics and Trade'}\n",

The other cohort was children aged 1 at the start of the project and became eligible for project-provided services two years later. The paper presents intent-to-treat estimates of impact in the short term (first year of the project) and medium term (three years after the project started), using experimental and quasi-experimental methods. For the cohort of 4-year-olds, while the magnitude of the enrollment impact is similar across children from different backgrounds, the impact on child outcomes is larger for children from more disadvantaged backgrounds in the short and medium terms. However, for this cohort of children, it seems that project-provided playgroups encouraged substitution away from existing kindergartens, suggesting that future interventions should incorporate such possibilities into their design. For the average child in the younger cohort, the project led to improvements in physical health and well-being as well as language and cognitive development. For this cohort, there is little evidence of differential impact. This can be explained by the fact that children who enrolled soon after the centers opened (the older cohort) were generally poorer, compared with children who enrolled later (the younger cohort).

There are a number of significant findings. First, the levels and impacts of conflict are far higher than previously expected, and even areas thought of as not being particularly prone to conflict, report high conflict impacts. Comparing the authors' data with that of a previous attempt to use newspapers to map conflict (UNSFIR), they find six times as many deaths. Second, there is significant variation between districts, not only in the impacts of conflict, but also in the forms conflict takes. This suggests that many of the causes of conflict are localized, and shows the limitation of theories that focus only on national factors. Different types of conflict exist in different areas and result in different impacts. Finally, the authors explore potential sources of bias in the data, through interviews with editors and journalists from the newspapers used in the study. The authors find that in general, newspapers can be used to provide a reasonably accurate conflict map, but that it is necessary to use sources below the provincial level. The analysis in this paper shows that violent conflict is significant in areas of Indonesia not normally associated with having high levels of conflict. A vital component of a strategy to promote violence-free development, must be to better understand the distribution, impacts and nature of violent conflict across Indonesia.\", 'last_modified_date': '2018-03-17T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Education'}\n",

Increasing longevity combined with low fertility and emigration have made Bulgaria’s age structure increasingly top-heavy and its dependency ratios higher. At the same time, the economic sectors that absorbed low-skilled workers during the high-growth early 2000s, such as construction and manufacturing, were those that contracted most during the 2008–09 economic crisis and they have not yet recovered. Meanwhile, activities demanding high-skilled labor, such as financial and business services and information, communication, and technology (ICT), have been faring relatively well. This study uses a new dataset with direct measures of cognitive and socio-emotional skills to examine the relationship between skills and labor market outcomes in Bulgaria. For a long time, labor market studies had to rely on formal educational attainment as a measure of an individual’s skills. However, the correlation between formal education and skills is not perfect, and not all diplomas are equal in terms of imparting certain skills to students. Moreover, valuable skills can be acquired without formal diplomas, for example through on-the-job training or learning-by doing. In addition to using educational attainment this study therefore looks at direct measures of two types of skills that employer’s value: cognitive skills, such as functional literacy and numeracy, and socio-emotional skills, such as self-discipline, perseverance, and ability to work well with others. The objective is to assess the extent to which these direct measures shed light on what matters for labor market success, defined as being in the labor force, being employed, and earning more. This analysis relies on original data (the Bulgarian Longitudinal Inclusive Society Survey, BLISS) collected by the World Bank and Open Society Institute–Sofia in the spring of 2013, which for the first time in the country included nationally-representative information on the cognitive and socio-emotional skills of the working-age population.', 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Education'}\n",

Matching bilateral trade and tariff data and controlling for tariff preferences, level of development, and standard distance measures, they find that infrastructure and institutional quality are significant determinants not only of export levels, but also of the likelihood exports will take place at all. Their results support the notion that export performance, and the propensity to take part in the trading system at all, depends on institutional quality and access to well-developed transport and communications infrastructure. Indeed, this dependence is far more important, empirically, than variations in tariffs in explaining sample variations in North-South trade.', 'last_modified_date': '2007-02-23T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Law and Development,International Economics and Trade,Transport'}\n",

Management of water resources at the regional rather than national level at that time helped address the issue of the uneven distribution of water between the Central Asian countries. However, new political structures established in the countries of Central Asia have challenged the Soviet systems of coordinated, cross-country technical analysis and decision-making on resource issues. The current state of water resource management in Central Asia is marked by the fragmentation of information and data, a scarcity of innovative diagnostic tools and analytical technologies, and a vast disparity in access and capacity to analyze water resources management issues among the countries.

However, on a larger scale, and with longer time-perspective, the relationship is much clearer: there are few, if any, instances of countries moving out of poverty without improving the net productivity of their natural resource base. In many instances, food security and livelihoods for the poor, depend largely on the ability to grow food locally, or use local natural resources - directly dependent on ecosystem goods and services.

The methodology permits tracing the endogenous relationship between fiscal multipliers and fiscal positions while maintaining enough degrees of freedom to draw sharp inferences. The paper reports three major results. First, the fiscal multipliers depend on fiscal positions: the multipliers tend to be larger when fiscal positions are strong (i.e. when government debt and deficits are low) than weak. For instance, the long-run multiplier can be as large as unity when the fiscal position is strong, while it can be negative when the fiscal position is weak. Second, these effects are separate and distinct from the impact of the business cycle on the fiscal multiplier. Third, the state-dependent effects of the fiscal position on multipliers is attributable to two factors: an interest rate channel through which higher borrowing costs, due to investors' increased perception of credit risks when stimulus is implemented from a weak initial fiscal position, crowd out private investment; and a Ricardian channel through which households reduce consumption in anticipation of future fiscal adjustments.\", 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Industry'}\n",

Both investors and managers respond to returns and crises, and substantially adjust their investments accordingly. These mechanisms generated large capital reallocations during the global financial crisis. Their behavior tends to be pro-cyclical, reducing their exposure to countries experiencing crises and increasing it when conditions improve.

            "{'id': '33035643', 'abstract': 'How can countries make sustainable gains in student learning at scale This is a pressing question for Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) – and the developing world more broadly, as countries seek to build human capital to drive sustainable growth. Significant progress in access has expanded coverage such that nearly all children in the region attend primary school, but many do not gain basic skills and drop out before completing secondary school, in part due to low-quality service delivery. The preponderance of evidence shows that it is learning – and not schooling in and of itself, that contributes to individual earnings, economic growth, and reduced inequality. For LAC in particular, low levels of human capital are a critical factor in explaining the region’s relatively weak growth performance over the last half century. The easily measurable inputs are well-known, and the end goal is relatively clear, but raising student achievement at scale remains a challenge. Why We propose that part of the answer lies in management, the processes and practices that guide how inputs into the education system are translated into outputs, and ultimately outcomes. While management (and related concepts, such as institutions, governance, or leadership) is often mentioned as an important factor in education policy discussions, relatively little quantitative research has been done to define and measure it. And even less has been done to unpack how and how much management matters for education quality. In this study, we begin filling these gaps, with new conceptual and empirical contributions that can be synthesized in four key messages: (1) student learning is unlikely to improve at scale without better management. (2) management affects how well every level of an education system functions, from individual schools to central technical units, and how well they work together. (3) management quality can be measured and should be measured as a catalyst for improvement. (4) several pathways to strengthening management are open to LAC countries now, with the potential for significant results. The study elaborates on each of these messages, synthesizing recent data and research and presenting the results of six new papers written to inform this report. The target audience for the Executive Summary is policymakers across LAC (and beyond) who are seeking approaches to strengthening their systems at scale.

The report takes a broad, multidimensional view of poverty, assessing progress over the past two decades along both monetary and nonmonetary dimensions. The dearth of comparable, good-quality household consumption surveys makes assessing monetary poverty especially challenging. The report scrutinizes the data used to assess monetary poverty in the region and explores how adjustments for data issues affect poverty trends. At the same time, the remarkable expansion of standardized household surveys on nonmonetary dimensions of well-being, including opinions and perceptions, opens up new opportunities.

Due to lack of reliable data on skilled labor, skilled and unskilled labor contents in exports were generated from the Global Trade Analysis Project database. A panel of 23 countries for which data on skills and manufacturing global value chains are available for 19 subsectors was constructed. A fixed-effect gravity model was used to estimate the determinants of backward and forward global value chain participation. The estimates obtained from the sample are compared with global data covering 115 countries for benchmarking purposes. The results indicate that for economies in Sub-Saharan Africa, skilled labor seems to be the strongest determinant of participation in backward and forward global value chains. Similarly, initial human capital endowment has a strong positive impact on global value chain participation at the global level. However, countries with relatively high initial capital endowment benefit more by incorporating foreign value-added products in their manufacturing exports. Finally, countries that receive net inflows of migrants tend to engage better in backward and forward global value chains than those with net outflows of migrants. The findings suggest that policies to improve Sub-Saharan Africa’s integration in manufacturing global value chains should target: shifting from unskilled to skilled labor-intensive backward and forward global value chain activities; upgrading the quality of the labor force, since unskilled workers are so far the most available and the most used in manufacturing global value chains; investing in the quality of human capital; and promoting intraregional skills mobility.\", 'last_modified_date': '2019-08-01T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Industry,International Economics and Trade,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth'}\n",

Its success in establishing democratic frameworks must be matched by corresponding achievements in macroeconomic stability.

This study documents the data challenges and revisits the core broad facts about poverty in Africa; the second report will explore ways to accelerate its reduction. The report takes a broad, multidimensional view of poverty, assessing progress over the past two decades along both monetary and nonmonetary dimensions. The dearth of comparable, good-quality household consumption surveys makes assessing monetary poverty especially challenging. The report scrutinizes the data used to assess monetary poverty in the region and explores how adjustments for data issues affect poverty trends. At the same time, the remarkable expansion of standardized household surveys on nonmonetary dimensions of well-being, including opinions and perceptions, opens up new opportunities. The report examines progress in education and health, the extent to which people are free from violence and able to shape their lives, and the joint occurrence of various types of deprivation. It also reviews the distributional aspects of poverty,by studying various dimensions of inequality. To shed light on Africa’s diversity, the report examines differences in performance across countries, by location, and by gender. Countries are characterized along four dimensions that have been shown to affect growth and poverty: resource richness, fragility, landlockedness and income status. To conclude, a portion of inequality in Africa can be attributed to inequality of opportunity, circumstances at birth that are major determinants of one’s poverty status as an adult.', 'last_modified_date': '2016-03-14T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Poverty Reduction,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Gender,Industry,Law and Development,Education'}\n",

The programs represent a range of sectors, geographies, contexts, and target populations; were both nongovernmental organization- and government-led; and represent programs implemented through social safety nets, livelihoods and jobs, and financial inclusion. Despite the challenges of the small number of studies available and limited comparability of impact and cost data, the findings indicate that a broad range of economic inclusion programs show promising and potentially sustained impact on a wide range of outcomes, with a bundled set of interventions showing larger impact on income, assets, and savings relative to stand-alone interventions.

By examining this question in the context of global value chains, this paper provides a much better understanding of the association as well as general validity.

The paper produces a rich panel data set from 2011 to 2017. The findings show that foreign direct investment has a positive effect on labor productivity in sectors and firms within those sectors. Moreover, global value chain participation plays a key role in shaping the foreign direct investment effects. Sectors with lower global value chain participation benefit more from foreign direct investment: doubling the foreign direct investment in those sectors results in an 8 percent productivity gain. The positive effect seems to be due to the increased competition created by foreign direct investment.

They are conceptually and functionally distinct from those tax provisions whose purpose is to raise revenue. Tax expenditure programs are comparable to entitlement programs. Therefore, tax expenditures must be analyzed in spending terms and integrated into the budgetary process to ensure fiscal accountability. In addition, tax expenditures must be audited for performance and the information must be published (with comprehensive analysis) to ensure fiscal transparency. The author analyzes the concept and definition, size, and effects of tax expenditures, as well as the fiscal accountability and transparency of tax expenditure spending. In short, tax expenditures affect (1) the budget balance, (2) budget prioritization in allocation, (3) the effectiveness and efficiency of fiscal resources, and (4) the scope for abuse by taxpayers, government officials and legislators. While reviewing the current practices in tax expenditures against the requirements of fiscal accountability and transparency, she finds that this fiscal area must be strengthened. The author sketches four building blocks to strengthen tax expenditures toward fiscal accountability and transparency, based on the literature developed by Surry and McDaniel, the practices from industrial and developing countries, the Campos and Pradhan fiscal accountability model, and the International Monetary Fund's fiscal transparency code. The author argues that normative/benchmark tax structure, a revenue-raising component of the tax system, should be formalized. The normative/benchmark tax structure should be legally defined in the tax law and should be transparent. The tax receipts from this normative/benchmark tax structure should be quantified and published. Presently, many countries could publish imputed tax revenue from normative/benchmark tax structures because such data is available. Only if imputed tax revenue is published in the same way as the other budget components-tax revenue received, tax expenditures, direct expenditures, and fiscal balance-will a budget system be truly transparent in terms of revenue-raising activities and expenditure activities. In addition, when the tax revenue-raising activity is formalized, the inherent spending nature of tax expenditures is further exposed. Therefore, tax expenditures should be added to direct expenditures forming total government expenditures. Furthermore, the conventional concept of the size of government should be remedied by including both direct expenditures and tax expenditures.\", 'last_modified_date': '2006-05-23T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Law and Development,Public Sector Development'}\n",

The official prices in centrally planned economies were never perceived by central planners to be fully market clearing. Only by coincidence would the overall price level correspond to the level associated with general equilibrium. What is missing in official price indices in centrally planned economies - including the consumer price index - is suppressed inflation, manifast in queuing for products, forced substitution of demand, and forced savings. Also missing is hidden inflation, associated with practices that disguise price increases behind cosmetic or other change in product quality. The authors argue that inflationary pressures in Czechoslovakia in 1985-89 originated mainly in the investment sector. Even though the investment sector was strictly controlled, making it difficult for open inflation to emerge, the scope for inflationary pressures was great in Czechoslovakia. Such pressures arose from a mixture of factors, including poor investment planning, accommodating government finance, and the high priority given to investments and social consumption. For Czechoslovakia, the official price indices show virtually no inflation between 1985 and 1989, when there were long waiting lists for such products as cars and state and cooperative flats. Trends in these price indices do not seem to depend on the method used for constructing them, according to the sensitivity tests conducted by Czechoslovakia's Federal Statistical Office. Obviously, the official price indices failed to capture the full extent of economic disequilibrium in that period. But the extent to which official price indices understated inflationary pressures was not serious in Czechoslovakia, compared with other centrally planned economies. Estimates of hidden inflation for 1985-89 range from 0.5 percent to 2 percent a year in consumer markets and about 3 percent in the industrial sector. Estimates for suppressed inflation were less than 5 percent. The relatively small inflationary gap is indirectly confirmed by the sharp inflation associated with the recent price liberalization that subsided in a relatively short period, and both suppressed and hidden inflations have virtually disappeared. Estimates of hidden inflation were based on benchmark price comparisons between Czechoslovakia and such market economies as Austria. Those for suppressed inflation were based on disequilibrium econometric models of asset holdings and on conjecture tests.\", 'last_modified_date': '2001-04-18T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'International Economics and Trade'}\n",

This TA on supporting water supply and sanitation has identified the need for a larger regional or global activity that can carry forward impact evaluations in the sector and produce global knowledge that will serve as a public good for the client countries. The TA also underscored the importance of upstream analytical work and replication of results in different contexts as well as the need to develop customizable tools and instruments for faster implementation of data collection efforts. Above all, the TA emphasized the need to invest in expanding local capacity in designing and implementing rigorous impact evaluations so that more evidence could emerge in the coming years for better policy formulation in the water and sanitation sector.', 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources,Health, Nutrition and Population'}\n",

Reciprocally, the authors show that as countries integrate into the world economy, the costs and benefits of gender discrimination shift. Their theory goes beyond a potential aggregate wealth effect associated with trade opening, and emphasizes the heterogeneity of impacts. On the one hand, countries in which women are empowered -- measured by fertility rates, female labor force participation or female schooling -- experience an expansion of industries that use female labor relatively more intensively. On the other hand, the gender gap is smaller in countries that export more in relatively female-labor intensive sectors. In an increasingly globalized economy, the road to gender equality is paradoxically very specific to each country\\x92s productive structure and exposure to world markets.\", 'last_modified_date': '2019-05-06T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Social Protections and Labor,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Gender'}\n",

            "{'id': '31867261', 'abstract': 'This study builds on recent efforts by the World Bank and the European Commission in generating detailed poverty estimates at detailed subnational levels (the EU Poverty Map). This information is combined with estimates of subnational trade flow data for subnational regions between 2000-2010, as well as information on country and regional characteristics. Poverty estimates from the EU Poverty Map refers to a relative concept of poverty, measuring the share of population below a country-specific low-income threshold. This notion of relative poverty can be informative of disparities in welfare gains within countries often associated with trade, especially given the current backlash on globalization from the perception that it may leave some segments of the population behind. The negative relationship between poverty and trade is observed when both import and export openness are considered individually, but it arises more clearly in the case of export orientation. Export orientation can be associated with lower levels of poverty particularly in the poorest regions. The relationship between import exposure and poverty rates is not significant. Additional analyses show that export openness is more strongly linked to lower poverty in regions where production tends to be more ‘low-tech’. All together, these results suggest that both exports and imports are associated to lower poverty, but especially when it relates to higher export opportunities in poorer regions and where production is concentrated in relatively labor-intensive goods. While this analysis does not consider micro-level effects such as at the enterprise or household level that could possibly show greater heterogeneity, the results suggest that cross-country estimates in the literature that show a positive effect of trade openness on economic performance tend to hold at subnational regional levels in the EU. Overall, this study shows that poverty and the relative concentrations of poor people in the EU is an issue that policymakers should put high on the agenda. Opening markets and creating a more level playing field in global markets for export opportunities is critical for regional development. For certain regions however, policies to support the transition and the mitigation of transition costs may be necessary.

The authors use international data and a new micro-data set of firms in thirteen Southern African Developing Countries (SADCs) to investigate the benefits and determinants of FDI in this region. FDI appears to have facilitated local development in the SADC region. Foreign firms tend to perform better than domestic firms, tend to be larger, are located in richer and better-governed countries and in countries with more competitive financial intermediaries, and they are more likely to export than domestic firms. They also exhibit positive spillover effects to domestic firms. Relying on a standard model to predict the country-level FDI inflows per capita, the authors find that SADC is attracting their expected level of FDI inflows, at least relative to its income level, human capital, demographic structure, institutions, and economic track record. There are some differences between SADC and the rest of the world in FDI behavior: in SADC, the income level is less important and openness more so. The authors use two comparison groups to compare with SADC to shed light on why other regions have attracted more FDI per capita than SADC. The factors that explain SADC\\x92s low FDI inflows are economic fundamentals (e.g., previous growth rates, average income, phone density, and the adult share of population).', 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Private Sector Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,International Economics and Trade,Finance and Financial Sector Development'}\n",

Therefore, if the marginal cost of reducing inequality relative to the marginal cost of increasing growth does not increase with lower poverty levels, to accelerate poverty reduction, greater emphasis should be given to equity rather than growth as countries attain higher levels of development.', 'last_modified_date': '2014-05-06T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Poverty Reduction,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth'}\n",

Based on data from 26 countries, people age 70 and older constitute 37 percent of deaths attributed to COVID-19 in LMICs on average, versus 87 percent in HICs. Only part of this difference is accounted for by differences in population age structure. In this paper, COVID-19 mortality rates are calculated for each age group by dividing the number of COVID-19 deaths by the underlying population. The resulting age-mortality curves are flatter in countries with lower incomes. In HICs, the COVID-19 mortality rate for those ages 70-79 is 12.6 times the rate for those ages 50-59. In LMICs, that ratio is just 3.5. With each year of age, the age-specific mortality rate increases by an average of 12.6 percent in HICs versus 7.1 percent in LMICs. This pattern holds overall and separately for men's and women's mortality rates. It reflects some combination of variation across countries in age patterns of infection rates, fatality rates among those infected, and under-attribution of deaths to COVID-19.

            "{'id': '32287322', 'abstract': \"The expansionary fiscal contraction (EFC) hypothesis states that fiscal austerity can increase output or consumption when a country is under heavy debt burdens because it sends positive signal about the country's solvency situation and long-term economic wellbeing. Empirical tests of this hypothesis have suffered from identification concerns due to data sources and empirical methodology. Using a sample of OECD countries between 1978 and 2014, this paper combines new IMF narrative data and the proxy structural Vector Auto-regression (SVAR) method to examine whether fiscal austerities can be expansionary when debt levels are high. Fiscal austerities are measured as 1) narrative fiscal shocks and 2) structural shocks from a proxy SVAR. Additionally, this paper uses a model-based approach to determine the cutoff debt level beyond which EFC is expected to be observed. This paper finds empirical evidence in support of the EFC hypothesis for OECD countries: results for output are driven by changes in tax rates and are robust to how one defines a high-debt regime and how one measures austerity.\", 'last_modified_date': '2020-07-30T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Public Sector Development'}\n",

Uganda's trade regime was more open in 2001 than in 1997, as during these intervening years Uganda has made considerable progress in providing a level playing field for the tradable sector. On the import side, lower maximum and average tariffs had significantly reduced the level of protection in 2001. On the export side, absence of export taxes and an effectively functioning VAT reimbursement scheme for exporters had sharply reduced the disincentives for exporting. By 2001, Uganda had also initiated policy changes for enhancing the efficiency and transparency of its trade regime through customs administration policy changes, duty-drawback schemes and policies aimed at reducing the scope for scope for administrative discretion in granting tariff exemptions. Due to these sustained policy changes, the overall anti-export bias of Uganda's trade regime was significantly lower in 2001 than in 1997. On the other hand, Uganda has used discriminatory excise taxes to raise the level of effective protection accorded to certain domestic industries. Uganda's trade regime would have been closer to the international good practice observed among low and middle income developing countries in the absence of such discriminatory excise taxes on imported goods. Despite the remaining weakness, however, Uganda's trade regime in 2001 was among the most open among the African countries to which the methodology developed by Hinkle et al has been applied to date.\", 'last_modified_date': '2019-05-04T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Law and Development,International Economics and Trade'}\n",

This difficulty is because the data required to measure resilience, which involves observing household outcomes over time after every exposure to a shock, are usually unavailable in many contexts. This paper proposes a new method for measuring household resilience using readily available cross section data. Intuitively, a household is considered resilient if there is very little difference between the pre- and post-shock welfare. By obtaining counterfactual welfare for households before and after a shock, households are classified as chronically poor, non-resilient, and resilient. This method is applied to four countries in the Sahel. It is found that Niger, Burkina Faso, and Northern Nigeria have high percentages of chronically poor: respectively, 48, 34, and 27 percent. In Senegal, only 4 percent of the population is chronically poor. The middle group, the non-resilient, accounts for about 70 percent of the households in Senegal, while in the other countries it ranges between 34 and 38 percent. Resilient households account for about 33 percent in all countries except Niger, where the share is around 18 percent.', 'last_modified_date': '2015-01-22T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Poverty Reduction'}\n",

            "{'id': '698094', 'abstract': \"The authors examine how the economic interactions between rapidly emerging China and the rest of the world may evolve over the coming two decades. They discuss China's growth potential, drawing a parallel between China's rise and the historical rise of Britain, Japan and the United States. Barring major disruptions, they contend, China could become one of the world's largest economies, if not the largest, by the year 2020. Industrial countries, especially Japan and the US , are expected to benefit because their trade structure complements China's. Developing countries, especially exporters of labor-intensive manufactured products, are likely to be put under competitive pressure. The authors argue that it would be advantageous for China to embark on the traditional strategy of a follower country -- that is, to run current account deficits and use foreign resources to supplement domestic investment. Should foreign direct investment continue at its recent rate, China may have to cope with overfinancing of its current account deficits. The authors argue for a development strategy that projects a sustainable growth rate with somewhat higher current account deficits and, therefore, somewhat higher levels of consumption and lower domestic savings, and a toning down of a policy bias that favors coastal regions. Such a strategy would lift consumption standards more rapidly. It would also defuse some of the social tensions generated by the unequal development of different regions. As for the country's vulnerability to the external environment, the authors argue that in the long run China is resilient in the face of adverse external developments, especially those coming from outside Asia. In the short term, however, adverse external shocks could threaten the macroeconomic stability important to reform. A simulation analysis of China's loss of most-favored-nation status in the US confirms this assertion. The authors conclude that preserving openness is in China's best interest and that the US in particular stands to gain much in the longer run if it maintains open trade relations with China. Adversarial US policies could encourage China, Japan and other Asian countries to prefer intraregional trade, possibly excluding the US from full participation in what is bound to be the world's most dynamic growth pole.\", 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'International Economics and Trade'}\n",

            "{'id': '696996', 'abstract': \"In 1985, after decades of an import-substitution industrial strategy, Mexico initiated a radical liberalization of its external sector. Between 1985 and 1988, import licensing requirements were scaled back to a quarter of earlier levels, reference prices were removed, and tariff rates on most products were substantially reduced. By 1989, Mexico was one of the most open economies in the developing world. Adjusting to trade liberalization required the reallocation of resources between sectors and entailed substantial dislocation of workers. The author analyzes how Mexico's trade liberalization (1985-87) affected employment and wages in indusry, focusing on how it affected average employment and earnings rather than on the link between trade and relative wages. She examines the tradeoff between wage and employment adjustment, identifies which labor groups benefited more from liberalization, and tries to associate changes in employment and wages directly with measures of change in trade protection, rather than link them to changes in imports and exports (which is more common). The author also finds that reductions in quota coverage and tariff levels are associated with moderate reductions in firm-level employment. A 10-point reduction in tariff levels (between 1985 and 1990) is associated with a 2- to 3- percent decline in employment in Mexico. Changes in quota average appear to have no discernible effect on wages, but reduction in tariff levels are associated with increases in average wages. This seems to reflect improved productivity in the reformed industries, which may be related to a shift toward the use of more skilled workers. There seems to have been a slight shift in the skill mix in favor of nonproduction workers. This was paralleled by a sharper increase in the wage differential between skilled and unskilled workers. The wages and employment of skilled production workers were significantly more responsive to changes in protection levels than those of nonproduction workers - perhaps partly because production workers were more heavily concentrated in the industries in which protection levels were greatly reduced.\", 'last_modified_date': '2001-04-21T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Finance and Financial Sector Development'}\n",

Perceptions are measured by aggregating individual-level data from regional barometer surveys. The main results show that negative perceptions of political conditions -- proxied by the share of the population that is generally dissatisfied with the way democracy works -- have a significant positive effect on the number of protests and strikes. Negative perceptions of economic conditions do not seem to be significantly related to the latter. This generally holds across a large sample of countries and is particularly the case for Western and Central European countries as well as high-income countries. In developing economies, however, social protests appear to be driven by dissatisfaction with economic and political conditions. The heterogeneous effects of perceptions on uprisings across geography and income groups, however, are not robust and susceptible to changes in estimators and model specification. In particular, the international contagion of protests eliminates this international heterogeneity, implying that the incidence of uprisings in nearby countries tends to generate protests at home through its effect on perceptions related to political conditions in high-income countries. Overall, the effect of perceptions about political conditions, along with protest contagion, is robust to the inclusion of numerous control variables that capture actual economic conditions and the quality of governance across countries. The results are also robust to the use of seemingly valid instrumental variables, alternative count-data estimators, and sample composition.\", 'last_modified_date': '2020-09-29T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Law and Development,Governance,Social Protections and Labor,Public Sector Development,Health, Nutrition and Population'}\n",

The survey provided data on rural residential energy use and costs for the same, the use of electricity in decentralized rural households. The survey also provided information for an analysis of the economic benefits of electricity use in areas of rural Peru. Finally, data were analyzed to provide implications for further development of policies for rural electrification in Peru. It is important to appreciate that the document represents the situation regarding rural electrification in Peru, in the period 2005-2006. The main conclusion of the survey is that rural households in Peru have the desire, willingness and ability to pay for significant electricity. Households without electricity often pay more for lower quality energy of kerosene lamps or batteries than they would pay for electric service. However, the need to pay the cost for connection is a major barrier, and 25 percent of households living in areas served do not have power connected. The use of automotive batteries for 18 percent of rural households without electricity is an important indication of the demand for electric service that is not satisfied. The survey provides information for planning of rural electrification in the context of Peru, including an estimate of the benefits, which are important particularly for economic analysis of projects. However, the authors believe that the survey will also be useful for other countries as an example of a comprehensive effort to collect and analyze original data from energy use in rural households.', 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Energy,Poverty Reduction,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth'}\n",

Since 2013 the government of Malawi (GoM) has been implementing a large-scale multisectoral nutrition program, which expanded to all districts of the country with the World Bank Group and other donor funding. At the start of this program a national baseline survey was conducted, and in early 2018, an endline survey was conducted. The endline survey followed a mixed-methods approach similar to the 2013 baseline survey, using both quantitative and qualitative data collection measurements. An Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition analysis was used to determine the pathways that contributed most to the program’s success. In addition, a panel dataset was constructed to compare the nutritional outcomes of children within the same household who were born before and after the program intervention. The findings of the endline survey confirm the positive trends observed in childhood malnutrition in Malawi. Between 2013 and 2018, nutrition indicators improved and the percentage of children under age five who were stunted fell from forty-two percent in 2013 to thirty-seven percent in 2018. Improvements were observed in some underlying factors: the percentage of deliveries attended by a skilled birth attendant and handwashing both improved significantly between 2013 and 2018. The findings from the decomposition analysis and cross-sectional and panel data suggest that improvements in water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH), in particular, handwashing and antenatal care (ANC) practices, were largely responsible for the observed improvements in child nutrition. The findings of the Community-Based Nutrition (CBN) Survey further suggest that the country should consider investing in more coordination and capacity at the district and community levels and should address inequalities in program performance across districts, delivering more context-specific investments and program designs while moving forward', 'last_modified_date': '2019-08-16T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Industry,Health, Nutrition and Population'}\n",

In May 2011, following an open bidding process, the Poverty Reduction and Economic Management - Gender and Development Group (PRMGE) contracted Universalia to carry out an external, formative, forward-looking mid-term evaluation. The objectives of the review were: (i) to identify the key achievements of the AGI towards implicit program objectives; (ii) to identify the progress of AGI pilot projects to date vis-a-vis their objectives; (iii) to identify strengths, areas for improvement, and lessons learned in the design, implementation, and management of AGI at both the program and pilot project levels; and (iv) to present specific, actionable changes to PRMGE to maximize AGI's potential impact and support the realization of the Bank's implicit AGI program objectives. The evaluation process was based on an evaluation framework developed in consultation with PRMGE that outlined key evaluation questions, indicators, and means of verification. Data collection was conducted using document, file, and literature review, as well as consultations with AGI stakeholders from inside and outside the WB. The evaluation noted considerable room for improvement in a number of areas that limit the AGI's ability to fully realize its inherent potential, in particular in relation to knowledge generation, cross country learning and building internal WB ownership. The evaluation found that the strong support and verbal endorsement of the AGI expressed by senior Bank management has not yet been matched by commitments of WB resources.

Adding to its strategic position are 1,200 miles of uninterrupted coastline that stretch from the Bay of Bengal to the Andaman Sea, and a wealth of natural resources. It has enormous potential to translate theseassets into progress for its 53 million people. Myanmar is a nation in transition, seeking to break with a past marred by authoritarian rule, economic mismanagement, and multiple conflicts that persist today, driven by social exclusion and predatory natural resource extraction. The country’s opening, in 2011, and the first democratic elections, in 2015, marked critical turning points for Myanmar, generating a wave of optimism. The Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement (NCA) started a new political dialogue on what the future structure of a democratic and inclusive Myanmar state could look like. Reforms led to remarkable progress on economic growth and improved living standards. Progress on economic transition has been substantial, whereas progress on political transition has been moderate, and progress towards peace more modest. The momentum of the transition has slowed recently. Resolute policy action is needed to accelerate growth and share its benefits more widely. Weak state response to the Rakhine crisis, heightened violence in Kachin, Shan, and Chin, and unsteady progress on harder, second generation economic reforms until recently have exposed the complexity of the transition process and revealed challenges to inclusive development. The military response in Rakhine State in 2017 against people who self-identify as Rohingya, which led to loss of human lives and the forced displacement of about 725,000 refugees to Bangladesh, exposed the limits of the democratic transition and was met by widespread international condemnation. Global economic uncertainty presents an additional challenge. In 2019, especially after the cut-off point for the analysis presented in this document,2 economic reforms have picked up. Reviving and sustaining progress in the three intertwined dimensions of the transition—from a planned to an open market economy, from military to civilian rule, from conflict to peace—will require deeper reforms and greater state institutional capacity. This Systematic Country Diagnostic is the second prepared by the World Bank since it reengaged with Myanmar in 2012. Building on the much larger body of data and evidence available today, it explores the drivers of Myanmar’s growth and poverty-reduction performance since the country’s opening, identifies the challenges to maintaining and improving this performance, and defines three pathways to address the challenges that lie ahead.

The analysis examines incentives to participate both in villages having formal community forest management, the core institution for implementing Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation, and villages having only informal forest user groups. Contrary to previous findings in the literature about participation incentives, but in keeping with other recent studies of Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation pilots in Nepal, this study finds that relatively little emission reduction would take place at prices of $1.00 to $5.00 per ton of avoided carbon emissions. Formal community forests will almost certainly be the core institution within which Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation is implemented in Nepal and likely other countries. The study finds that average and median values of payment required for agreement to reduce fuelwood collection are substantially larger for formal forest user groups than in informal communities. This reflects that formal groups likely already have fuelwood collection restrictions in place, whereas informal groups may de facto permit open access extraction. The analysis also suggests that households that are part of informal groups react to Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation very differently than households that are formal group members. Broadly speaking, \"underprivileged\" formal group member households, such as those who are landless, female-headed, and poor, appear to be warier of fuelwood collection restrictions and thus require higher payments than average respondents. This difference does not appear to carry over to informal group members.', 'last_modified_date': '2018-11-19T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Rural Development,Energy,Water Resources,Health, Nutrition and Population,Science and Technology Development,Environment'}\n",

In turn, this provides for easy breeding ground to vector disease carriers, conducive to high mortality rates. Mitigation addresses health, education, and issues related to construction works as follows. During roads, and drainage construction, community participation will be promoted by intensive awareness campaigns, to prevent refuse dumping along the open drain channels, and the misuse of improved structures. To this end, polythene bags will be provided to households, to be disposed at refuse bins, which will then be emptied regularly by trucks and tippers at selected disposal sites. Inadequate borehole systems, and treatment of steel tanks cause water contamination, thus strict monitoring of water supply systems will be ensured in design specifications, and fully observed, and enforced in compliance with local regulations. In addition, water users committees will be established community wise, to ensure regulations are observed. Operation and maintenance of sanitation facilities will be in strict observance with local regulations, and in compliance with Bank's environmental guidelines, to prevent surface water, and groundwater contamination, thus containing the spread of water borne diseases.

That metaphor applies not just to the vulnerable in the rich world; the vulnerable in the rest of the world are not more immune. Yet, despite the extensive spread of the virus, the mortality toll remains highly concentrated in high-income countries. Developing countries represent 85 percent of the global population, but only 21 percent of the pandemic's death toll. This unusual inequality creates the impression that the world is subjected to two different pandemics in terms of their impact. This paper documents the observed inequality with a new indicator that expresses severity relative to pre-pandemic patterns. It argues that the excessive skew towards rich countries is inconsistent with demography. Simulations based on reasonable ranges for infectivity and fatality suggest that the developing country share in global fatalities could rise by a factor of three (from 21 to 69 percent). Environmental and host-specific factors will influence these results but are unlikely to overturn them. While data quality has a role in explaining ‘excess inequality’, the more compelling explanation is that the pandemic has yet to run its course through the age distributions of the world.\", 'last_modified_date': '2020-06-04T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Law and Development,Industry,Health, Nutrition and Population'}\n",

To a high-income country with notable exposure to natural perils and significant vulnerabilities to external shocks, the liquidity angle of the Cat DDO is a welcome safety net but not the only selling point. The Project helped the GoS to advance and push reforms - and most importantly build and strengthen capacities, both in core DRM areas as well as in cross-cutting topics like geospatial data, coastal management, and risk-informed land-use planning. Despite a fix results framework, this instrument offers some flexibility to adjust to evolving client priorities and grants room for support beyond immediate targets through trust funded Technical Assistance linked to the Cat DDO project. Finally, the external support and expertise provided by the Bank may also offer an opportunity to foster a more strategic and comprehensive cross-sectoral resilience dialogue and strengthen agencies in their role to lead such a dialogue. Climate and disaster resilience can also have positive economy-wide implications for tourism-dependent island state, for example through quicker recovery and safeguarding (environmental) assets, people’s livelihoods, and external image. Given the context of small island states and the complexity and cross-cutting nature of DRM, Cat DDOs should account for broader capacity building needs and Task Teams be flexible and open to adapt. Due to their size and characteristics, small island states have limited capacities (e.g. few individuals or entities need to cover a broader range of government activities and responsibilities, limited resources for building local expertise, etc.) and the government often needs to fulfill both local and national functions at the same time. Task Teams should acknowledge these dynamics by not overengineer activities and by being prepared to deliver extensive and strong technical assistance to reach ambitious goals.

In the literature, a prominent argument why countries sign \"deep\" agreements is to promote and facilitate the operation of global value chains. This paper exploits a new data set on the content of trade agreements and data on trade in value added and in parts and components, to quantify the impact of the depth of trade agreements on bilateral cross-border production linkages. The results show that adding a policy area to a trade agreement increases the domestic value added of intermediates (forward global value chain linkages) and the foreign value added of intermediates (backward global value chain linkages) by 0.48 and 0.38 percent, respectively. At the sectoral level, the positive impact of deep trade agreements is higher for higher value-added industries, suggesting that deep agreements help countries to integrate in industries with higher levels of value added. For a larger sample of countries and years, the results confirm that an additional provision in a trade agreement increases bilateral trade in parts and components by 0.3 percent. The content of trade agreements also matters for global value chain integration, but the impact varies by income group. Provisions outside the current mandate of the World Trade Organization (investment and competition policy) drive the effect of trade agreements on North-South trade in parts and components.

            "{'id': '697919', 'abstract': 'Many agricultural regions in the developing world are subject to severe droughts, which can have devastating effects on household incomes and consumption, especially for the poor. To protect consumption, rural households engage in many different risk management strategies - some mainly risk-reducing and some simply coping devices to protect consumption once income has been lost. An important limitation of these traditional risk management strategies is their inability to insure against covariate risks and they are also costly.. The absence of formal credit and insurance institutions, which offer an efficient alternative by overcoming regional covariance problems and reducing the cost of risk management, amounts to a market failure. Past research has paid much more attention to the supply-side reasons for this market failure than to the demand side question of whether there exist financial instruments that farmers want and would be willing to pay for. The authors use a dynamic household model to examine the efficiency of drought management strategies used by peasant households. An attractive feature of the method is that it exploits actual production (input-output) data and does not deal with the usually unreliable data on household consumption and leisure activities. The model is applied to a two-year panel of data on households from five villages in Tamil Nadu (South India). The sample is small, but the data are special, as one of the two years was a severe drought year. The results indicate that agricultural households exhibit significant risk-avoidance bahavior, and that even though they may use a range of risk management strategies, there still remains an unmet demand for insurance against drought risks. The study did not estimate the likely costs of supplying drought insurance, but the latent demand in the study region is strong enough to more than cover the breakeven rate of approximately the pure risk cost (the probability of drought) plus 5 percent administration costs. The findings confirm the inadequacies of traditional strategies of coping with droughts in poor rural areas. Because of the catastrophic and simultaneous effects of droughts on all households over large areas, there is limited scope for spreading risks effectively at the local level. Either households must increase their savings significantly (a problem with low average incomes and an absence of safe and convenient savings instruments), or more effective risk management aids are needed that can overcome the covariation problem. Improved financial markets (with both credit and savings facilities) could be helpful, particularly if they intermediate over a larger and more diverse economic base than the local economy. Alternatively, formal drought insurance in the form of a drought (or rainfall) lottery might be feasible, and the results suggest that it could be sold on a full-cost basis.', 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Poverty Reduction'}\n",

Using national data from the Uganda National Panel Survey for 2009/10 and 2010/11, the gap before controlling for endowments was estimated to be 17.5 percent. Panel data methods were combined with an Oaxaca decomposition to investigate the gender differences in resource endowment and return to endowment driving this gap. Although men have greater access to inputs, input use is so low and inverse returns to plot size so strong in Uganda that smaller female-managed plots have a net endowment advantage of 12 percent, revealing a larger unexplained gap of 29.5 percent. Two-fifths of this unexplained gap is attributed to differential returns to the child dependency ratio and one-fifth to differential returns to transport access, implying that greater child care responsibilities and difficulty accessing input and output markets from areas without transport are the largest drivers of the gap. Smaller and less robust drivers include differential uptake of cash crops, and differential uptake and return to improved seeds and pesticides.', 'last_modified_date': '2020-05-20T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Agriculture,Gender,Poverty Reduction'}\n",

As they undertake efforts to increase tax compliance, streamline business start-up, enhance data sharing, improve public service delivery, reduce administrative burdens, and monitor the health of financial systems, governments are implementing unique business identifiers (UBIs) as part of their larger approach to achieving these goals and realizing the related benefits. A UBI provides the foundational information related to legal entities, enabling government and business to uniquely identify legal entities in various transactions and regulatory interactions. This guidance note draws on a set of nine case studies looking at individual country efforts to implement a UBI. This note explores the emerging good practices that these countries have employed in addressing these challenges. Effective implementations begin with creating a clear vision as well as strong governance and leadership structures for both the implementation effort and the longer term operation of the solution. This note outlines the key institutional, legal, and technology issues and challenges involved in implementing a UBI, and explores approaches that governments have taken to address them. Finally, the paper provides a high-level roadmap that identifies the common activities to support the delivery of a UBI implementation - including governance structures (both implementation and operational); legal, capacity, privacy, and organizational assessments; monitoring and evaluation approaches; and technical architecture and solution design.', 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'N/A'}\n",

Central Africa refers to CEMAC-Communaute Economique et Monetaire de l'Afrique Centrale-comprised of Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, and Gabon. CEMAC policy directions are: a) to deepen regional integration by making the customs union effective, enforcing macroeconomic policy convergence, and pursuing financial sector integration; and b) to promote cooperation on sector policies and projects. The challenge is to develop an institutional architecture that best combines integration and cooperation activities. At this point, institutions other than the central bank (BEAC) are still weak. The Bank's strategy is based on the premise that regional integration can contribute to poverty reduction by strengthening the links between the poorer landlocked countries and their more prosperous coastal neighbors and more generally by helping establish the basis for faster economic growth. It will be guided by the principles of open regionalism, subsidiarity, and participation of private sector and civil society. The Five-Year Bank assistance is designed to support CEMAC in the two domains of integration and cooperation, and with two degrees of Bank involvement: core activities where the Bank foresees a leadership role for itself and non-core activities, where it would act as an associate when another development partner is partner. The Bank will also provide support to institutional strengthening which straddles the two domains. The program summarized in the report includes a contingent category for studies of long-term issues. Risks to regional integration are: a) an intensification of political; b) a serious deterioration of economic management due to fiscal profligacy or external shocks (e.g., oil shocks); and c) a half-hearted implementation of policy decisions, e.g., protecting inefficient industries.

From an agricultural economy based on a narrow range of export commodities the country has developed into one that is sometimes numbered among the world’s newly industrializing countries. But the agro-industrial sector remains important. After years of considerable diversification Thailand still retains its position as one of Asia’s leading agricultural exporters, although the growth of manufacturing and services has reduced the dominance of agriculture, particularly since 1986. The changes in the economic structure since 1960 have been brought about in the context of an open economic system which has promoted maximum private sector investment. Government investment activity in the early stages of planned development was concentrated on the provision of infrastructure. These activities served to open up large areas of new agricultural land for cash crop cultivation and, combined with investment incentives, encouraged the rapid development of an industrial sector, based on import-substitution. Growth continued during the 1970s as Thailand was able to find major export markets for some of its key crops, as well as for new manufactured goods, notably textiles and garments. Since 1990 the fastest growth has been in higher technology goods, such as computer accessories and motor vehicle parts. While the annual growth rates of Thailand’s international trade transaction thus gathered and maintained a high profile for a considerable period of time, a growing number of issues has emerged since the mid-1990s that constitute serious threats to the country’s ability to sustain internationally competitive exports. The contributing factors are manifold pointing to structural defects in policies and regulatory regimes on the domestic scene. These circumstances have brought about a situation in which several elements of the national economy, relevant to industrial and trade performance, have become increasingly dysfunctional. Significant changes in the global markets, exemplified by fundamental restructuring in production and trading organizations and practices, exacerbate the threats to Thailand’s continued ability to sustain export growth. Indeed, with respect to several previously important export commodities, especially in the textile and garment sectors, Thailand has already lost major market shares to regional competitors.', 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Law and Development,Infrastructure Economics and Finance,International Economics and Trade,Informatics'}\n",

The findings link evidence on the contemporaneous effects of conflict with its persistent impact, especially by combining multiple data sources such as night lights, indicators of political exclusion, and nutrition. There is a strong level effect on output arising from the intensity of conflict, which, contrary to perceptions of post-conflict booms, on average is not reversed by subsequent more rapid growth. The paper investigates two possible channels that make conflict persistent: refugee flows and investment. Both channels display wide variation across recovery episodes, and are capable of large surges, which can in some cases generate rapid recoveries. Where recoveries lack buoyancy --which is the case for many post-conflict episodes -- deeper political constraints appear to be at work, which may ultimately relate to the effectiveness of power sharing.

The paper uses an innovative empirical strategy matching household survey, oil production, and domestic and international price data to capture three separate channels linking income changes to conflict. Price increases of consumed items have a significant conflict-inducing effect consistent with the hypothesis that they reduce real incomes and thus the opportunity cost of fighting. Failure to include this consumption impact severely biases (toward zero) the conflict-reducing effect of price rises of agricultural commodities via production. In addition, oil price hikes increase conflict intensity in oil producing areas, consistent with the \"rapacity\" hypothesis. However, this effect disappears in the period after the agreement granting amnesty to militant groups in oil-producing areas. The paper also discusses the importance of factors mediating the impact of the shocks on conflict and a number of policy implications following the analysis. Finally, the empirical strategy is employed to unveil a strong relationship between income shocks and violence in the current Boko Haram conflict. The analysis suggests some policy implications, which may be relevant for the Nigerian context and beyond.', 'last_modified_date': '2015-03-11T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Poverty Reduction,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Private Sector Development'}\n",

It describes the structure and trends in cigarette production in Egypt, and the level of imports and exports. Part 2 uses household expenditure survey data from 1995/96 and 1999/2000 to look at levels and trends in household expenditures on cigarettes and other tobacco products, by income level, education, rural/urban residence, works status and occupation. The same data are used to analyze the demand for cigarettes and other tobacco products in Egypt, estimating expenditure (income) and price elasticities for the various population subgroups. The results are comparable to similar empirical estimates from other countries. The elasticities are used to simulate the likely effect on consumption of a rise in the price of cigarettes. The results of a survey of knowledge, attitudes and behaviors with respect to tobacco use of 559 university students are reported.

It is a common practice when making these forecasts to use econometric models that were originally developed for short-term forecasting of relationships in developing countries. Evaluation of the models requires consideration of the reliability of the data from which they are estimated, the significance of the coefficients of their equations, the functional form of their equations, their propensity to use certain statistical tests in a mechanical way, and their use for making forecasts for the future. One has the choice to either use the model with its associated and discredited equations and coefficients, or not to use it.

But unlike trade liberalization in Europe, most trade barriers in Latin America have been reduced unilaterally. Recently bilateral or multilateral agreements have been considered, especially preferential trade agreements within the region. The author evaluates the relevance and desirability of multilateral free trade agreements (such as NAFTA) for the Latin American continent and the Caribbean, with an emphasis on how they affect trade flows. Is a preferential trade agreement among some Latin American countries more or less likely to be meaningful than others - important in intensity of impact, or beneficial, or both The evidence strongly suggests little likelihood that these agreements will succeed in Latin America. Paradoxically, the intense liberalization in recent years has made it less likely that such agreements would be beneficial - except possibly for agreements between some countries and Brazil, Mexico, or (to a lesser extent) Argentina. When the level of tariffs and nontariff barriers is already low, a preferential agreement is more likely to have an adverse impact than a beneficial one (although in any case only a slight impact). Between countries, the patterns of exports and imports are similar, suggesting a potential for trade diversion. Most countries would benefit from a preferential agreement with the United States, however. And U.S. agreements with blocks of Latin American countries are no more beneficial to those countries than are U.S. agreements with individual countries.\", 'last_modified_date': '2001-04-21T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'International Economics and Trade'}\n",

Using novel geo-referenced and high- frequency data, this study investigates the extent to which soil moisture anomalies drive international migration decisions within the region and toward Europe. The findings show that drier soil conditions decrease (rather than increase) the probability to migrate. A standard deviation decrease in soil moisture leads to a 2 percentage point drop in the probability to migrate, equivalent to a 25 percent decrease in the number of migrants. This effect is concentrated during the crop-growing season and likely driven by financial constraints. The effect is only seen for areas that are in the middle of the income distribution, with no impact on the poorest or richest areas of a country, suggesting that the former were constrained to start and the latter can address those financial constraints.', 'last_modified_date': '2021-05-17T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Environment,Science and Technology Development,Agriculture,Health, Nutrition and Population,Poverty Reduction'}\n",

They increasingly encompass non-trade-related disciplines as diverse as intellectual property rights, environment laws, or labor market regulations. Moreover, because investment is complementary to trade, preferential trade agreements provide relevant institutional frameworks to partner countries that wish to regulate their foreign investments. This paper studies the impact of deep trade agreements on foreign direct investment and examines three sub-questions. First, is the impact of trade agreements on foreign direct investment heterogeneous across types of business activity Second, is this impact heterogeneous across disciplines covered in the agreements Third, does the level of development of home and host countries matter for this impact The analysis exploits the World Bank’s data set on the content of preferential trade agreement and data on announcements of bilateral greenfield investment at the activity level. The findings show that deep trade agreements matter for investment: every additional discipline in a preferential trade agreement increases foreign direct investment by 1.4 percent, on average. Deep agreements do not impact foreign direct investment in natural resources and extractive activities and have heterogeneous effects across manufacturing- and services-related activities. The results also reveal that disciplines that go beyond the mandate the World Trade Organization matter more for foreign direct investment. Disciplines related to investment liberalization and protection, intellectual property rights, or migration increase foreign direct investment, whereas disciplines on labor market regulations reduce investment.

This new and unequivocal finding distinguishes the current study from past studies that only utilized aggregate aid data and returned ambiguous results.

Countries default more often when they lack rules and strong institutions to curb the influence of powerful groups on government policies. That is because in a polarized government, each powerful group makes decisions without considering the impact on other groups. Simulations of the model show that more than half the cross-country variation in sovereign default frequencies can be explained by institutional quality and the degree of government polarization observed in the data.\", 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Private Sector Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Finance and Financial Sector Development'}\n",

The main findings are: (1) annual exporter entry, exit, and survival rates in Latin America and the Caribbean are quite similar to what is observed in other countries, and entry rates across sectors are quite similar but survival rates appear to be highest in agriculture; (2) the relative size of entrants into export markets (relative to incumbents) tended to be lower for natural resource-abundant countries during 2005-2007, but less so during the crisis years of 2008-2009; (3) entry rates tend to be lower in sectors in which a country has revealed comparative advantage, however, exit rates and survival rates of new exporters are higher in those sectors; and (4) the low growth of exports during the global recession of 2008-2009 in Latin America and the Caribbean was due to lower growth in exports of incumbent firms\\' pre-existing products and destinations, while new products and destinations tended to attenuate the recession\\'s effects.

The GEGI is simple and transparent and can be easily constructed using closed-form expressions for almost all countries using macroeconomic employment rate data by gender. The basic variant of the GEGI is the gap between male and female employment as a share of total employment. The full GEGI is similar, but instead of using an aggregate employment gap, the full GEGI is the weighted average of a “better employment gap” and “other employment gap.” The basic and full GEGIs are similar (correlation of 0.97), and both average 19 percent across countries. This means that GDP per capita in the long run would be almost 20 percent higher if female employment were exogenously increased to be the same as men’s (other things being equal).

Improved accountability and responsiveness are critical for reaching the goals of eliminating extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity with a focus on improving the well-being of the most vulnerable and marginalized groups in society. Within the broader political economy context, many questions remain unanswered about the role that new technologies can play to act as an accelerator for closing the accountability gap. Within this context, this report brings together new evidence from leading academics and practitioners on the effects of technology-enabled citizen engagement. The report aims to address the following four main questions: how do new technologies empower communities through participation, transparency, and accountability; are technologies an accelerator for closing the accountability gap - the space between supply (governments, service providers) and demand (citizens, communities,civil society organizations) that must be bridged for open and collaborative governance; under what conditions does this occur; and what are the experiences and lessons learned from existing grassroots innovators and donor-supported citizen engagement and crowdsourcing programs, and how can these programs be replicated or scaled up. The report presents a theoretical framework about the linkages between new technologies, participation, empowerment, and the improvement of poor people's human well-being based on Amartya Sen's capability approach.

Similarly, adjusting government interventions in the maize market, which have been shown to inflate maize prices by 20 percent on average, could reduce poverty by 1.8 percent.

Both investors and managers respond to returns and crises, and substantially adjust their investments accordingly. These mechanisms generated large capital reallocations during the global financial crisis. Their behavior tends to be pro-cyclical, reducing their exposure to countries experiencing crises and increasing it when conditions improve.

The framework presents a risk assessment of the present state of health care waste management and presents findings according to each step in the management process: waste generation, waste segregation, containerization, internal transport and storage, external transport, treatment, disposal, and wastewater. Risks cited at every step were: the absence of incentives to minimize the volume of waste; risk of infection from the steam sterilization of needles, syringes, and surgical gloves; the absence of regulation of particular hazardous materials such as mercury, and other heavy metals, chlorinated compounds; the lack of awareness of the need to consistently segregate medical wastes from domestic waste; the absence of lids and lack of plastic lining of waste containers, increasing the risk of spreading infectious micro-organisms both during waste transport and cleaning of the containers; cases where waste is transported manually implies a risk of infection to the sweepers if they are not wearing protective clothing; the transport of waste in uncovered vehicles posing a risk as well as a nuisance to the public; the dumping of waste out in the open before being transported to the dumpsite where scavengers (including children) scrounge around for recyclable material; the generation of noxious gases from burning wastes in open fire; the burial in the ground of pathological waste; the decomposition of the organic content of waste in the ground, generating leachate that will flow into the river; the absence of sanitary landfills in Nepal with that could protect against groundwater pollution; and the risk of discharge of treated and untreated wastewater may pose risk to people collecting water for households, fields and gardens, washing, playing, for religious purposes, and spreading ashes from cremation.

Specifically, competitive pressure should discipline or eliminate inefficient producers. This article explores whether or not there is such a dynamic link. It uses a previously unexploited data set to gauge the impact of the 1990 Peruvian reform on plant-level technical efficiency.

Nevertheless, Surinam's economy has several features in common with other developing countries. The economy is heavily dependent on one product, bauxite, and it is notably open, making it highly susceptible to fluctuations in world demand. Also, wide economic disparity exists between the urban and rural sectors, including the distribution of essential social services. The government's development strategy involves much greater government responsibility for economic growth. Emphasis is on development of the country's natural resources, removal of regional disparities, and product diversification. Due to the lack of skilled manpower, this program may be overly ambitious. The task facing Surinam in the short run is to restore economic growth and reduce unemployment; over the long run it is to lessen external dependence and strengthen the structure for self-reliant growth.\", 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Environment,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Health, Nutrition and Population,Finance and Financial Sector Development'}\n",

For small and medium-size enterprises, these effects were larger in countries with less efficient legal systems, weaker information-sharing mechanisms, shallower banking systems, and more restrictions on bank entry.

Growing evidence suggests that lack of access to credit prevents many households and firms from financing high-return investment projects, which has an adverse effect on growth and poverty alleviation. Despite the increasing awareness of the importance of access to finance among both researchers and policymakers, there are still some major gaps in our understanding of the main drivers of access, as well as about the impact of different policies in this area. This book aims to fill some of these gaps by discussing recent innovative experiences in broadening access to credit in Latin America. These experiences are consistent with an emerging new view that, while recognizing the central role of the public sector in improving the contractual and informational environment for financial markets, also contends that there might be room for well-designed, restricted interventions in collaboration with the private sector to foster the development of financial markets and broaden access to them. In particular, the book analyzes, among other things, some interesting experiences from Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Mexico that use different instruments to broaden access to credit in a sustainable way, such as structured finance, factoring, credit guarantees, and correspondent banking. Most of these experiences have led to financial innovation by developing new financial products and coordinating different players in the financial and real sectors to overcome barriers to access to credit. The book provides a first systematic analysis of these innovative experiences, including an analytical framework to understand problems of access to finance and a discussion of the effects and optimal design of public interventions. Finally, the book discusses some open policy questions about the role of the private and public sectors (including state‐owned banks) in broadening access to finance in a sustainable and market-friendly manner.', 'last_modified_date': '2017-11-08T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'N/A'}\n",

Their analysis of the new data suggests that a sizable fraction (about half, on average) of funds switched to dollar deposit accounts are effectively exported through the banking system, thereby reducing the supply of credit. Moreover, increases in deposit dollarization are associated with increases in offshore deposits, which probably helps to explain the authors' finding that dollarization is associated with an increase in banking spreads. The authors' evidence supports, though only weakly, the conjecture that dollarization would tend to raise wholesale interest rates systematically through a peso premium. In contrast, greater dollarization is clearly associated with a higher pass-through coefficient from exchange rate change to consumer prices, potentially increasing nominal risk in the economy.\", 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Finance and Financial Sector Development'}\n",

Health care waste is categorized as follows: infectious waste (bandages and cotton and paper tissue with blood), pathological waste (including body parts, fetus and placentas), sharps ( injection needles, scalpels), pharmaceutical waste (outdated and spilled medicines), genotoxic waste (including waste from cancer treatment), chemical waste (discarded solid and liquid chemicals from laboratories, insecticides), waste with high content of heavy metals (broken mercury thermometers, chemicals for developing x-ray photos), pressurized containers, and radioactive waste. The framework presents a risk assessment of the present state of health care waste management and presents findings according to each step in the management process: waste generation, waste segregation, containerization, internal transport and storage, external transport, treatment, disposal, and wastewater. Risks cited at every step were: the absence of incentives to minimize the volume of waste; risk of infection from the steam sterilization of needles, syringes, and surgical gloves; the absence of regulation of particular hazardous materials such as mercury, and other heavy metals, chlorinated compounds; the lack of awareness of the need to consistently segregate medical wastes from domestic waste; the absence of lids and lack of plastic lining of waste containers, increasing the risk of spreading infectious micro-organisms both during waste transport and cleaning of the containers; cases where waste is transported manually implies a risk of infection to the sweepers if they are not wearing protective clothing; the transport of waste in uncovered vehicles posing a risk as well as a nuisance to the public; the dumping of waste out in the open before being transported to the dumpsite where scavengers (including children) scrounge around for recyclable material; the generation of noxious gases from burning wastes in open fire; the burial in the ground of pathological waste; the decomposition of the organic content of waste in the ground, generating leachate that will flow into the river; the absence of sanitary landfills in Nepal with that could protect against groundwater pollution; and the risk of discharge of treated and untreated wastewater may pose risk to people collecting water for households, fields and gardens, washing, playing, for religious purposes, and spreading ashes from cremation. To minimize some of these risks the report suggests: \"green\" procurement (purchasing substitute items posing less risk to the environment), waste reduction, recycling, and reuse; quantitatively assessing waste products; waste segregation, handling, transport, treatment, and disposal practices, pollution prevention; and training staff and educating the public about proper waste management.', 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Health, Nutrition and Population'}\n",

The survey was conducted on representative samples of the non-institutionalized civilian population over age 15.8 The survey included three questions related to ID that were asked in 97 countries: (1) whether or not a person had their country's national ID or equivalent foundational ID credential; (2) for those with the ID, whether they had used it for specific purposes; and (3) for those without the ID, what their reasons were for not having one. In five economies with no ID system or very limited coverage, people were asked a single question on whether or not they had been unable to access certain services due to lack of identity documents (see Annex 2 for full text of questions). Combined with other individual-level indicators from the 2017 Global Findex, these data provide new insights into who has an ID, how they are used, and persistent barriers to access. At the same time, the data have some limitations. First, while the ID4D-Findex questions cover countries that represent close the three-quarters of the world's population, they do not cover all countries. For example, most high-income countries, some low- and middle-income countries, and some smaller economies are not included. In total, the countries included in the ID4D-Findex data account for a little over 80 percent of the population in low and lower-middle income countries. Second, the Findex survey is limited to people ages 15 and older, and therefore does not capture the identity gap or correlates of identification for the youngest people. Importantly, we have restricted the analysis in this paper to those respondents who are above the age when the ID is mandatory, using information from the ID4D Global Dataset. In countries where the mandatory ID age is greater than 15 years old, excluding these observations provides more conservative estimates of the gap in identification than if they were included, as young people may not have an ID simply because they are not yet eligible or required to have one.\", 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Information and Communication Technologies,Finance and Financial Sector Development,Education,Gender'}\n",

It aims at providing the Government with a more solid base on which to shape a poverty reduction strategy. To do so it focuses on analyzing the areas left open by the PRSP, which have mostly to do with the lack of reliable and detailed information on the characteristics, incidence and dynamics of poverty today. A household survey (the CWIQ) was conducted in early 2003 to obtain quantitative data that provide a basis for up to date estimates. At the same time, a qualitative study based on participatory fieldwork provided insight into the perceptions of the poor themselves as well as a deeper understanding of the phenomenon. The report is organized in five chapters (excluding the overview): Chapter 2 looks at poverty mostly from a macro- economic perspective. I t first focuses on the recent (1987-2000) economic growth of the country, pointing at the main factors that may explain the performance of Benin's economy. It then looks at the national data available on poverty (in terms of consumption levels and assets) and at inequality. The chapter concludes with simulations of the impact of economic growth on poverty reduction, and a look at the government's PRSP and the likelihood that Benin will reach the Millennium Development Goals (MDG). Chapter 3 focuses on poverty at the household level, and is introduced by a brief description of how the poor perceive poverty. An analysis of the characteristics (or determinants) of poverty is followed by an examination o f the sources of inequality and by an analysis of poverty as vulnerability, looking at the major risks facing the poor. After surveying the geographical distribution of poverty and vulnerability, the chapter examines how poverty affects the life of people living in cities, how it particularly impacts children, and the survival strategy of the poor. Chapter 4 tries to shed some light on rural poverty by looking at the way in which agro-ecological characteristics, and socioeconomic factors and policies interact. Particular attention is paid to cotton, given its importance for the country. Chapter 5 concludes with a series of policy recommendations for the development of the agricultural sector in the perspective of poverty reduction. This chapter examines the poor's access to education, health care, nutrition, and water and sanitation. An overview of the situation and main challenges in each sector is followed by an analysis of government policies and suggestions for improving access by the poor to these basic needs.

Yet, measurements of this relationship are still scarce and not always reliable. The authors present additional evidence at both the sectoral and household levels based on recent data. Results show that rural poverty reduction has been associated with growth in yields and in agricultural labor productivity, but that this relation varies sharply across regional contexts. Gross domestic product (GDP) growth originating in agriculture induces income growth among the 40 percent poorest, which is on the order of three times larger than growth originating in the rest of the economy. The power of agriculture comes not only from its direct poverty reduction effect but also from its potentially strong growth linkage effects on the rest of the economy. Decomposing the aggregate decline in poverty into a rural contribution, an urban contribution, and a population shift component shows that rural areas contributed more than half the observed aggregate decline in poverty. Finally, using the example of Vietnam, the authors show that rapid growth in agriculture has opened pathways out of poverty for farming households.

First chapter, 'a framework for SSN reform,' describes and illustrates the reasons for the region's growing need for SSN reform and establishes the framework for renewed SSNs. It identifies key goals for SSNs (promoting social inclusion, livelihood, and resilience) and illustrates how these goals have been achieved in some parts of the region and elsewhere. Second chapter, 'key challenges that call for renewed SSNs,' analyzes the challenges facing the region's poor and vulnerable households, which SSNs could focus on as a priority. Two large groups are at higher-than-average poverty risk: children and those who live in rural or lagging areas. The chapter examines factors such as inequality of opportunities and lack of access to services that can perpetuate the lower human development outcomes among the poor in these groups. It also describes the challenge of vulnerability. Finally, it identifies particular social groups that are at a higher risk of exclusion from access to services and employment.

Sustained ecosystem damage can trigger regime shifts and generate systemic impacts on human well-being and economies. For example, the degradation of natural ecosystems has been associated with an increase in the probability of emerging infectious diseases. The COVID-19 pandemic is likely an example of how the disturbance of ecosystems can have systemic consequences. As biodiversity is often seen as a public and therefore open access good, its conservation, restoration, and sustainable use rely heavily on scarce public sector finance. Simultaneously, governments are spending vast amounts to promote economic activities that are potentially harmful to biodiversity. This paper argues that governments and regulators, supported by financial institutions and multilateral development banks (MDBs), hold the key to mobilizing private finance at the scale needed to transform the way we build, produce, and consume to protect nature while fostering sustainable poverty reduction. The analysis looks at two key approaches to mobilizing private finance for biodiversity. First, it assesses opportunities for financing green, that is, the financing of projects that contribute, or intend to contribute, to the conservation, restoration, and sustainable use of biodiversity and its services to people. Second, it looks at greening finance, that is, directing financial flows away from projects with negative impact on biodiversity and ecosystems to projects that mitigate negative impact, or pursue positive environmental impact as a co-benefit. Despite growing innovation in both categories, significant challenges to scaling up private finance remain. These include policies that exacerbate the underpricing of biodiversity; lack of data, measurement, and reporting standards; and issues with biodiversity investment opportunities, which tend to be small scale and noncommercial, making private sector financing a challenge. The paper provides a set of recommendations for governments, regulators, companies, financial institutions, and MDBs. These are synthesized into a set of big five approaches to mobilize private finance for biodiversity: environmental fiscal reforms to realign incentives with sustainable practices; national biodiversity data provision and planning; the establishment of a Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) to support biodiversity reporting; the establishment of a Nature Action 100 to drive change in the companies whose activities most threaten biodiversity; and the provision of catalytic, concessional capital for biodiversity funds and projects.', 'last_modified_date': '2023-09-04T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'N/A'}\n",

Sri Lanka was a relatively affluent open agricultural economy at the time of its independence from colonial rule in 1948, with one of the highest levels of per capita income in Asia, a vibrant democracy, and levels of health, education and other human development that rivaled even those of many developed industrial economies. The process of policy liberalization from the late 1970s eroded the former overall anti-agricultural bias. Direct taxation of export crops was sharply reduced in the 1980s and largely eliminated by the early 1990s, and manufacturing trade liberalization drastically lowered the indirect burden on agriculture flowing from industrial protectionism. But policy reforms have been both limited and selective in the import-competing parts of the agricultural sector. Many import-competing agricultural industries, including not only rice but also several others such as sugar, potatoes and dairy, have continued to enjoy both direct input subsidies and, to varying degrees, protection through the trade regime. Protection from import competitions and direct assistance to food agriculture have failed to achieve their stated goals of adequately encouraging production of staples and reducing the growing gap between rural and urban household incomes.

They examine how corporate ownership and control influence the behavior of state firms, as illuminated by the following survey findings and conclusions: (a) Contrary to expectations, state firms took painful adjustment measures. Enterprise managers firmly believed that privatization was coming. This belief led them to manage better, not worse; a private sector based economy means a market for managers and a premium on skilled management. (b) The excess wage tax (the much criticized \"Popiwek\" scheme) did restrain wage-setting behavior, judging from the wage-setting equations presented by the authors. (c) Essential to the good performance of state industries is an end to open-ended subsidies. Subsidies, rather than helping firms adjust, give them incentives to continue their past behavior and destroy any mechanism of control other claim-holders might have. (d) Commercial banks, the Polish experience shows, can be made to exercise governance over state firms. Without effective takeover mechanisms, withholding funds is their most powerful instrument. That instrument is made powerless if firms, pressured to adjust by banks, can turn to the government themselves.

However, very few look at other collateral effects, such as the incidence of violence. Between 2009 and 2014, El Salvador implemented the Temporary Income Support Program, which aimed to guarantee a temporary minimum level of income to extremely poor urban families for six months, as well as provide beneficiaries with experience in social and productive activities at the municipal level. Making use of a panel data set at the municipal level for 2007 to 2014, with monthly data on different types of crime rates and social program benefits by municipalities, this paper assesses the effects of the program on crime rates in municipalities in El Salvador. There are several possible channels through which the Temporary Income Support Program can affect crime. Since the program is associated with cash transfers to beneficiaries, a reduction in economically motivated crimes is expected (income effect). But since the program enforces work requirements and community participation, this could generate a negative impact on crime, because the beneficiaries will have less time to commit crime and because of community deterrence effects. Overall, the paper finds a robust and significant negative impact of the Temporary Income Support Program on most types of crimes in the municipalities with the intervention. Moreover, the negative effects of the program on some types of crime rates hold several years after participation. Positive spillover effects for municipalities hold within a radius of 50 kilometers.', 'last_modified_date': '2018-03-27T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Communities and Human Settlements,Social Protections and Labor,Urban Development,Health, Nutrition and Population,Public Sector Development,Social Development,Rural Development'}\n",

However, at 14 percent of gross domestic product, its logistics costs are high relative to the 8 to 10 percent that is typical of most advanced economies. High logistics costs and poor logistics performance impact the competitiveness of the economy on multiple levels: (1) firms deliver less competitive goods and services; (2) consumers pay more than peers for goods; and (3) the cost of achieving improvements in gross domestic product is excessive. The development of a national transport and logistics network to facilitate competitiveness and sustainable development and uplift rural regions will play an increasingly important role in shaping spatial organization in emerging economies. An element that is absent, yet critically important for national logistics issues in emerging economies, is sufficiently detailed freight-flow analysis to facilitate targeted infrastructure investments and enable transformational change to improve national logistics performance. This paper presents the results of a disaggregated macroscopic freight demand analysis developed for India through a hybrid approach, calibrating the modeled input-output matrix and resulting freight flows with data where available. Data was obtained from multiple sources, such as agricultural statistics, national enterprise surveys, a financial performance database of Indian companies, population statistics, and transportation statistics from rail, inland waterways transport, highways, and ports. The model provides evidence for decision making on several levels. Aggregating freight flows enables planners to identify gaps in critical infrastructure and logistics chains. Disaggregated flows support decisions on the location of logistics clusters, maximizing the potential of multimodal transport systems, and designing the distribution and storage networks that underpin the economy.', 'last_modified_date': '2018-02-13T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'N/A'}\n",

For the cluster-level productivity analysis (as measured by output and value added per worker), it combines two established data sources in a novel way by importing average 'industry-size-location' cluster-level business environment variables from the World Bank Enterprise Survey to the comprehensive Sri Lanka Census of Industry productivity data available for similar clusters of enterprises. For the firm-level total factor productivity analysis, it compares data from the 2011 World Bank Enterprise Survey with those from 2004. For the firm-level innovation analysis, it compares findings from the 2011 World Bank Enterprise Survey with a representative sample of enterprises collected as part of the Sri Lanka Longitudinal Survey of Enterprises.

First, they estimate a single equation with a public sector dummy, which is found to be statistically significant and positive when only monetary wages are taken into account. However, when in-kind payments and bonuses are included to measure compensation, the analysis finds a private sector premium. Second, they estimate for public and formal private employees two distinct wage functions, including the inverse Mills ratio. This takes into account the selection bias resulting from workers self-selecting into the public or private sector. Third, these results are used to decompose wage differentials using the standard Oaxaca-Blinder approach. The results show that the compensation differentials are not significant except for the sub-sample of employees that achieved a postgraduate degree.', 'last_modified_date': '2011-10-26T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Public Sector Development,Social Protections and Labor,Poverty Reduction,Education'}\n",

It introduces a tripartite classification of GVC involvement—backward, forward, and two-sided—extending beyond trade to include production data. GVCs, vital for global economic growth, are networks through which companies internationally produce goods and services. The advanced framework accurately assesses how different combinations of domestic output, trade, and GVC integration correlate with growth and output stability. The paper finds that traditional trade-based GVC metrics significantly underestimate global GVC activity and misrepresent participation in key sectors like services and upstream manufacturing. They also exaggerate risks during critical stages like early trade liberalization in large economies. Additionally, it shows that traditional backward-forward classifications overestimate backward linkages. The new metrics, applied to established models, effectively predict trade disruption impacts, indicating that GVC participation increases exposure to external shocks but also enhances overall output stability by mitigating local shocks. Furthermore, GVC participation is a key driver of the positive trade-income growth correlation. The complete dataset of these new measures is available on the World Bank’s WITS Platform, and it is regularly updated, providing a key resource for GVC analysis.', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-12T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Social Development,Law and Development,Governance,Industry,Public Sector Development,International Economics and Trade,Transport'}\n",

Given the demography of rural households in Tajikistan where the phenomenon of female-headed households is quite significant, women ‘s access to land and credit assumes special importance. To date, however, no thorough gender analysis of access to land and finance in Tajikistan has been conducted. As a result, there is insufficient gender disaggregated data to inform policy. It is not clear how effective the reforms are in addressing factors inhibiting women ‘s access to land and their ability to benefit from any changes. In addition, due to the lack of data, no comprehensive microeconomic study on access to finance has been done. Many Tajik women are sole heads of households and caretakers of their families as a direct consequence of war and migration. Migration in particular has a great impact on gender relations, gender division of labor, and gender roles with the possible empowerment or disempowerment of women left behind. Households headed by women in Tajikistan are 28.6 percent more likely to be poorer than those headed by men. Improving and securing access to land and ensuring the gender sensitivity of land reforms, therefore, has potential for improving the conditions of these vulnerable households. The reports propose several areas of action. While fostering women ‘s access to agricultural production can be considered a policy for improving basic welfare, access to finance is an important ingredient for increased productivity and farm growth (i.e., professionalization and potentially commercialization). Financial access opens up opportunities to diversify income generation beyond farming activities. Complementary initiatives for women ‘s empowerment support their access to productive assets and entrepreneurial standing in society, and may simultaneously lift women ‘s self-constraints in demand for finance.', 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Finance and Financial Sector Development'}\n",

It is the first strategy for Morocco that was prepared jointly by IBRD, IFC and MIGA. The CPS is aligned with strategic priorities of the Government, as reflected in Morocco’s new Constitution and the Government’s program for 2012-2016. It is also aligned with the WBG’s twin goals of eliminating extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity in a sustainable manner. The Government’s program is based on the constitutional principles of inclusion, good governance, human rights, protection of individual freedoms, institutional responsibility and accountability, sustainable development, and more decentralized systems of governance. In support of this program, the CPS proposed to scale up support for Morocco’s open governance and green growth agendas, improve private sector-led competitiveness, support global integration, and deepen the focus on the accountability and capacity of public institutions. The CPS recognized that promoting citizen’s voice and participation, transparency and data access, and putting greater focus on gender and youth, were integral to these efforts. Overall, the Morocco CPS remains highly relevant, and its cross-cutting themes of youth, gender and voice are directly linked to the first pillar of the new MNA Strategy. While the PLR does not recommend changes to the CPS strategic objectives and results areas, it proposes adjustments to the new lending and advisory services and analytics (ASA) planned for the remainder of the CPS period. In particular, to further strengthen the linkages to the new MNA strategy, some of the originally planned operations have been dropped in order to consolidate the focus on interventions that directly address the issues of youth, gender, education, inequality, and employment-generating activities.', 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Education'}"

It applies a Tobit regression model across the full cross-country sample of Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability scores and country variables to identify potential causes for the observed underperformance of Pacific Island countries relative to other countries of similar income. First, the analysis finds small population size to be negatively correlated with Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability scores, with the \"population penalty\" faced by small Pacific Island countries sufficient to explain observed underperformance. Second, through application of a new capacity index of Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability dimensions, it finds strong evidence in support of the hypothesis that small population size impacts scores through the imposition of capacity constraints: with a limited pool of human capital, small countries face severe and permanent challenges in accessing an adequate range and depth of technical skills to fulfill all functions assessed through the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability framework. These findings suggest that approaches to strengthening public financial management in small Pacific Island countries should involve: i) careful prioritization of public financial management capacity toward areas that represent binding constraints to development; ii) adoption of public financial management systems that can function within inherent and binding capacity constraints, rather than wholesale adoption of \"best practice\" imported systems; and iii) consideration of options for accessing external capacity to support public financial management systems on a long-term basis, from regional agencies, the private sector, or donors.', 'last_modified_date': '2013-03-11T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Public Sector Development,Private Sector Development,Health, Nutrition and Population,Finance and Financial Sector Development'}\n",

Some lessons learned included: for public sewerage systems, Household (HH) connections are essential components to ensure that most of the organic loading is conveyed to the treatment facility and sufficient flow is maintained for the system to function properly. Connection to the HH was an issue in the past because tertiary lines were not extended close to the HHs, thereby imposing heavy financial burden on HHs if they attempted to connect. All coastal cities in Vietnam had weak soil formation and hence, construction methods are critical to minimize the damages to existing structures located near deep excavation sites. Damages could be reduced if the scope of land acquisition at the start of work is determined taking into account the soil foundation factor. Related to this, as the land management system in Vietnam is still weak, identification of land ownership and land use history should be more accurate to avoid ongoing complaints from the affected people. Vietnam has quite a number of medium-sized cities that are growing fast and looking for an intervention on environmental sanitation. The rational question to raise here would be whether a programmatic approach for this situation will fit better rather than the traditional single investment lending for each city. Urban environmental sanitation intervention is highly contextual and varies widely from city to city (characteristic of waste, differences in urban economy, land, sources of waste, and others).

The employment of ecological solid waste management, particularly waste segregation at source, would mean considerable decrease in solid wastes that will end up in rivers, roadways and other places in the city. Furthermore, the operation of the facility can very well improve the environmental quality of the city with the permanent closure of the former dumpsite, in accordance with an approved closure plan. The closure plan should include site cleaning, site grading and stabilization of any critical slopes, application and maintenance of soil cover, and provision of drainage control system. It should also include operational improvements that will consist of prohibition of waste burning and putting up of signage stating that the dumpsite is closed. Moreover any adverse impact of the MRF and composting subproject will generally be minimal and can be easily addressed before they become major problems.', 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Environment,Water Supply and Sanitation'}\n",

Its coverage ranges from the macro economy to financial markets to indicators of human welfare and development. It is intended for a wide audience, including policy makers, business leaders, and financial market participants, and the community of analysts and professionals engaged in Indonesia's evolving economy. The challenge for Indonesia is to maximize the opportunities that this brings, in terms of enhancing future growth and making investments that can improve the welfare of the entire population, while managing the associated risks. Strong capital inflows, particularly portfolio, have been seen across emerging markets, including Indonesia. These inflows are driven by yield differentials and the stronger growth prospects, and improved creditworthiness, of emerging economies relative to heavily indebted, higher-income economies. Further quantitative easing in the US has provided an additional, cyclical boost to this trend. Global commodity prices also picked up in recent months. In November, the US dollar price of non-energy commodities rose by 3.4 percent over the month with food and raw material prices up by 4.9 percent and 7.6 percent, respectively. The underlying drivers were strong growth in demand from emerging economies, particularly China, and also supply disruptions in the agriculture sector.\", 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Private Sector Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Finance and Financial Sector Development'}\n",

This paper argues that, because of the way it is often measured, it has also led to the misperception that financial globalization in emerging markets has been growing in recent years. The authors characterize the evolution of financial globalization in emerging markets using alternative measures, and find that, in the 2000s, financial globalization has grown only marginally and international portfolio diversification has been limited and declining over time. The paper revisits the empirical literature on the implications of financial globalization for local market deepening, international risk diversification, financial contagion, and financial dollarization, and finds them to be rather limited. Whereas financial globalization has indeed fostered domestic market deepening in good times, it has yielded neither the dividends of consumption smoothing (in line with limited portfolio diversification) nor the costs of amplifying global financial shocks. In turn, financial de-dollarization has largely reflected the undoing of financial offshoring and the valuation effects of real appreciation.', 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Private Sector Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Finance and Financial Sector Development'}\n",

The paper appeals to strong transfer as well as an additional cross-dimensional convexity property to offer axiomatic justification for distribution-sensitive multidimensional poverty measures. Given the nonlinear structure of these measures, it is al also shown how the problem of an exact dimensional decomposition can be solved using Shapley decomposition methods to assess dimensional contributions to poverty.

In order to be able effect their far-reaching transformative objectives, the architects of the Russian program had to assure that the program had the support of some sufficiently powerful political and economic forces within the old system. The program had to have some losers and some winners, and the winners could not be all in the future. But the program also attempted to make it more likely that the structure it put in place would then evolve in such a way as to mitigate some of the dangers implicit in the initial compromises. The main losers in the Russian privatization program were to be the old centralized industrial structures: branch ministries, industrial associations, trusts, and other lobbies for the status quo. The main winners, the forces with which the reformers allied themselves in the great push for quick privatization, were to be the managers and the workers of individual state enterprises, provided they broke away from the old structures. The reformers' assumption behind these moves was, presumably, that the overwhelming insider-domination of the privatized firms would not be desirable in the long run, but that the interests of the local insiders would be less monolithic than those of the old industrial lobby, and that the resulting new ownership structure would be subject to gradual change. Even at this early date, it can be said with confidence that the Russian design was very successful in effecting a huge ownership transformation of the Russian industry. It can also be stated that the most successful of its elements was the gamble on the insiders.\", 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Finance and Financial Sector Development,International Economics and Trade,Private Sector Development,Energy,Public Sector Development,Governance'}\n",

The report builds on Product Market Regulation (PMR) indicators and the WBG’s Markets and Competition Policy Assessment Tool (MCPAT) applied to the Philippine markets to (i) develop the main aspects of the advocacy role of the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) against current market features; (ii) map regulatory restrictions to competition and classify them according to their effects; (iv) contextualize competition restraints within each sector to offer a set of policy recommendations; and (v) quantify the potential impact of a more pro-competitive regulatory environment for the Philippines’ economy. As the country did not have a competition law until 2015, the recently created PCC faces a challenging environment in which to implement its mandate. The two-year transitory period to start enforcement, as well as the potential to grant broad exemptions from the law under the forbearance clause, have hindered the ability of the PCC to prevent anticompetitive conduct of market players, either public or private. In this context, the advocacy role of the PCC offers a critical mechanism to address those regulatory conditions that may be enabling anticompetitive behavior.

It finds that the quality of policy increases, but at a diminishing rate, with the cumulative number of policy loans. Similar results hold for the cumulative number of conditions attached to policy loans, although quadratic specifications indicate that additional conditions may even reduce the quality of policy beyond some point. The paper measures the quality of economic policy using the World Bank\\'s Country Policy and Institutional Assessments of macro, debt, fiscal and structural policies, and considers only policy loans targeted at improvements in those areas. Previous studies finding weaker effects of policy lending on macro stability have failed to distinguish loans primarily intended to improve economic policy from other loans targeted at improvements in sector policies or in public management. The paper also shows that investing in economic policy does not \"crowd out\" policy improvements in other areas such as public sector governance or human development. The results are robust to using alternative indicators of policy quality, and correcting for endogeneity with system generalized methods of moments and cross-sectional two-stage least squares.

The paper uses a large sample of countries spanning 1960-2014 to show that country size is a significant factor affecting countries' volatility, comovement with gross domestic product and real interest rate, and persistence. Specifically, analysis finds that smaller countries (i) tend to have more volatile gross domestic product; (ii) have more volatile, less procyclical, and less persistent investment; (iii) exhibit more volatile trade balance and current account, have more procyclical exports, and thus less countercyclical trade balance; (iv) have more volatile government consumption and more procyclical public revenues and fiscal balance; and (v) possess more procyclical inflation. The effects of country size remain robust even after we control for the level of economic and institutional development, the presence of fiscal rule(s) and fixed exchange rates, and the commodity exporting status.\", 'last_modified_date': '2018-07-12T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Public Sector Development,International Economics and Trade'}\n",
            "{'id': '31049748', 'abstract': 'Credit constraints are considered to be an important barrier hindering adoption of preventive health investments among low-income households in developing countries. However, it is not obvious whether, and the extent to which, the provision of labelled micro-credit -- where the loan is linked to the investment only through its label -- will boost human capital investments, particularly when it is characterised by other attractive attributes, such as a lower interest rate. This paper studies a cluster randomised controlled trial of a sanitation micro-credit program in rural India, which made available lower interest loans for sanitation. The loans were linked with sanitation through their name only. The loans were not bundled with any toilet, and loan use was weakly monitored, but not enforced. Hence it is not directly obvious that the loan should boost sanitation investments. A simple theoretical framework indicates that the intervention could increase sanitation ownership through three channels -- relaxation of credit constraints, salience of the loan label, or the lower interest rate. The presented empirical evidence, combined with model predictions, allow to conclude that the loan label -- which to date has not received much attention in the literature -- significantly impacts households borrowing and investment behaviour. Labelling loans is thus a viable strategy to improve uptake of lumpy preventive health investments.', 'last_modified_date': '2019-05-07T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Industry,Science and Technology Development,Education,Water Resources,Environment,Health, Nutrition and Population,Water Supply and Sanitation'}\n",

The World Trade Organization (WTO) had recently been created, the United States, Mexico and Canada were implementing North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and much of Southeast Asia and South America were near the peak of an economic boom that was driven in part by greater openness to inflows of foreign capital. In bilateral and multilateral discussions of economic integration, global migration was often missing from the docket entirely. The growth in labor flows from lowincome to highincome countries has not been greeted with universal enthusiasm, either by policy makers or academics. In theory, international migration increases economic efficiency by shifting labor from lowproductivity to highproductivity environments. As workers move from Central America to the United States, North Africa to Europe, or Southeast Asia to Australia, the global labor supply shifts from labor abundant to laborscarce economies, compressing international differences in factor prices and raising global gross domestic product (GDP). Migrants enjoy large income gains family members at home share in these gains through remittances, and nonmigrating workers in the sending country enjoy higher wages thanks to a drop in local labor supply (Aydemir and Borjas, 2007).', 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Social Protections and Labor,Health, Nutrition and Population,International Economics and Trade,Social Development,Communities and Human Settlements'}\n",

It discusses the political economy context of the policy changes, looks at reform initiatives that were implemented for the generation sector, describes transmission and distribution segments at different points in the evolution of the sector, and concludes with a summary of lessons learned and a suggested way forward. The evolution of private participation in the Indian power sector can be divided into different phases. Phase one was launched with the opening of the generation sector to private investment in 1991. Phase two soon followed - early experiments with state-level unbundling and other reform initiatives, including regulatory reform, culminating in divestiture, and privatization in Orissa and Delhi respectively. Phase three, the passage of the electricity act of 2003 by the central government, followed by a large increase in private entry into generation and forays into transmission and experiments with distribution franchise models in urban and rural areas during the 11th five-year plan (2007-12) period. In phase four, at the start of the 12th five-year plan (2012-17), the sector is seeing a sharp reduction in bid euphoria and greater risk aversion on the part of bidders, who are concerned about access to basic inputs such as fuel and land. In this context, the report is structured as follows: chapter one gives introduction; chapter two presents private sector participation in thermal generation; chapter three presents private sector participation in transmission; chapter four deals with private sector participation in distribution; chapter five deals with private sector participation in the Indian solar energy sector; chapter six deals with financing of the power sector; chapter seven presents emerging issues and proposed approaches for the Indian power sector; and chapter eight give updates.', 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Rural Development,Governance,Public Sector Development,Private Sector Development,Energy'}\n",

In reaction, demand for digital solutions is increasing sharply, including in matters of development policy and operations. The availability and scale of digital-driven development solutions has grown significantly, enticing a wide range of stakeholders to rethink how they define and deliver their value propositions, and jointly investing in a culture of technology innovation and adoption. The World Bank’s 2016 world development report, titled digital dividends, provided a balanced analysis of the digital dividends that developing countries and emerging economies can expect to reap, while also highlighting the vast digital opportunities and gaps that exist, and the risks if some countries remain left behind the digital revolution. The World Bank’s digital development partnership (DDP) was established in October 2016 to operationalize the key messages of WDR 2016, offer a platform for digital innovation and development financing, and assist low and middle-income countries to reap the benefits of the digital age. Recognizing that digital progress is primarily private sector driven, DDP brings public and private sector partners together to catalyze support to developing countries in the articulation and implementation of digital development strategies and operational work programs. This report captures the initial efforts to meet our digital development aspirations during DDP’s first year, and it provides a forward-looking perspective towards more progress in year two of its operation.', 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Governance,Information and Communication Technologies,Public Sector Development,Poverty Reduction,Transport'}\n",
            "{'id': '30778123', 'abstract': 'Economic growth was robust in 2017, above expectations. This was thanks to favorable external developments in the region, continued expansionary fiscal policy, and growth in the gold sector. Real GDP growth reached 4.6 percent in 2017, up from 4.3 percent in 2016, and the fastest rate since 2013. During the first 4 months of 2018, growth slowed to 1.3 percent, from a year earlier, as a result of the contraction in gold production; excluding gold, output grew at 2.5 percent, up from 2.3 percent over the same period in 2017. In short, the economy appears to have fully recovered from the recent shock brought about by the fall in oil prices. Investment and consumption drove output growth last year. Sources of growth appear to have been balanced. Growth was mainly driven by consumption and investment, with: private consumption growth returning to positive territory, after two consecutive years of contraction and high rates of public and private investment. Net exports also made a positive contribution, thanks to robust export growth. With the regional downturn now over, it is time the authorities should seize the opportunity for fiscal reform. First and foremost, action is required on the fiscal side to increase discipline and policy quality, transparency and consistency. In the past years, the authorities have deliberately delayed planned fiscal consolidation to accommodate the external shocks. As a result, public debt has remained elevated and fiscal buffers have been depleted. Moreover, fiscal discipline (in the context of relaxed targets) has been achieved at the cost of ad hoc measures, which entail reduced spending efficiency. It is now time to reverse this trend through implementing the recently adopted fiscal rule, tax administration reform and concrete measures to contain recurrent spending (to preserve room for investment). Additional steps to improve spending quality, include ensuring that planned amendments to the Public Procurement Law safeguard best international practice and that steps are taken to improve public investment management. In the long run the core challenge is to increase overall productivity in the economy. Creating and preserving fiscal space for investment in infrastructure is key, including via reforming energy tariffs. Significant long-term payoffs can also be expected from implementing the ambitious digital agenda under the Taza Koom flagship program. The Special Focus section of this report highlights the main challenges the country will face in this regard.', 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Poverty Reduction,International Economics and Trade,Industry,Information and Communication Technologies'}\n",

Their initial morphology and relation to water were based on rice intensive culture. This has created a form with urban rural interlinked characteristics, with differentiated and specified features embedded in unique geological and ecological water landscapes. Ben Tre is one of the most characteristic water-orchard culture city along Hau and Tien rivers in the Mekong delta. Ben Tre land embraces diverse geo-hydro-ecology layers which have been formed and continually transformed in the thousand-year process of the whole river delta formation and transformation. Differing from other areas of the Mekong delta, in Ben Tre province, the dense original water body provides the land with abundant aquatic and irrigational resources. The urbanization process that started in the 1990s has replaced parts of the productive landscape with fragmented development surrounding the core city and along its connecting regional and provincial roads. The road-based urbanization process with its generic urban, industry economic development has undermined the water connectivity and Ben Tre people water related economic activities, and therefore their livelihood. Meanwhile in the context of climate change and SLR now and in the future, the risks can be severe for Ben Tre, when the weather become more fluctuating and critical, with either higher flooding levels in the rainy season or prolonged droughts causing the increase of salinity in the dry season. Ben Tre has strong assets to undertake an important socio-economic and spatial transformation but the city will have to reconcile economic growth, social inclusion, and protection of its fragile hydrological balance in the face of growing climate change concerns. It is recommended that the city rethinks its ambitions in terms of urban development with risk informed integrated planning and decision making.', 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Communities and Human Settlements,Environment,Science and Technology Development,Water Resources,Urban Development,Health, Nutrition and Population,Transport,Agriculture'}\n",

Utilizing variation in firstborn gender and dowry amounts across marriage markets, the paper finds that the prospect of higher dowry payments at the time of a daughter~^!!^s marriage leads parents to save more in advance. The higher savings are primarily financed through increased paternal labor supply.

In FY16, the WBG institutions were busy responding to these new demands, and at the same time, continued to implement the institutional change initiative aimed at delivering effective solutions to clients with agility. Supporting this institutional endeavor, IAD has acted as a trusted partner of the Board and Senior Management.

            "{'id': '697101', 'abstract': 'The government of Lao PDR has made clear its intention to balance the development effort in urban and rural areas and to see the benefits of growth shared among the poor and non-poor alike. The context for this policy approach is the experience of the rapidly growing East Asian economies, most of which have achieved an extraordinary result. They have actually increased the equality of income distribution and dramatically reduced poverty, while sustaining the highest economic growth rates in the world. The Government of Lao PDR has demonstrated its commitment to economic growth as the surest guarantor of increasing welfare for all through the adoption of a sound macro policy framework, including strong expenditure and monetary discipline to sustain low inflation; a legal policy framework favorable toward new productive investment; and openness to global capital flows and trade. The report recommends the broad outline of a social development strategy to complement the growth priorities. The strategy has two basic components: first, increasing the opportunities for the rural poor to participate in economic growth; and second, to increase the human resource capacities of the rural poor to take advantage of those opportunities. In the first case, the social development strategy entails a coordinated series of interventions to raise the productivity of agriculture, to increase stock of rural transport and market infrastructure, to improve the competitiveness and market orientation of Lao farmers through technology and information services and improvements in the relative prices of food in the economy. For the second component, the report recommends steps to improve the performance of the educational system in order to prepare Lao youth for the challenges of a market economy. The report also analyzes the health system and recommends steps to improve its availability and quality for the rural poor, whose health status and access to services is as low as the least develpoed countries of the world.', 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Poverty Reduction'}\n",

Of particular concern are the contributions made by parental education, household wealth, and community characteristics, some of which are manipulable by government policy. The results show that both a mother's and a father's education have positive effects on weight for height, and that the mothers education has positive effects (though not precisely estimated) on height. The impact of community characteristics is strong. Of these, local wage rates, the health environment and the quality of health infrastructure seem to matter most. Unobserved household level factors are shown to be quite important, which suggests the need to account for them in an explicit way. In addition, there seem to be strong effects of intrahousehold distribution, particularly for children of household heads and their senior wives.\", 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Poverty Reduction'}\n",

            "{'id': '30471298', 'abstract': 'Unemployment rates in the region are among the highest in the world, especially for young graduates. Recent analytic work trying to explain weak job creation and insufficient private sector dynamism points to formal and informal barriers to entry and competition. These barriers privilege a few (often unproductive) incumbents who enjoy a competition edge because of their connections or ability to influence policy making and delivery. Renewing the social contract one of the pillars of the new World Bank strategy for the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) requires a new development model built on greater trust; openness, transparency, inclusiveness, and accountable service delivery; and a stronger private sector that can create jobs and opportunities for youth in the region. Policy recommendations in the field of governance for private sector policy making have been rather general and often removed from concrete, actionable policy outcomes. This book proposes to move beyond analytically documenting these issues and for the first time fill this policy and operational gap. The book proposes an innovative conceptual framework that encapsulates the governance features that could shield policies from capture, discretion, and arbitrary enforcement that limit competition.

While overall employment of women in manufacturing does not increase after the reforms, there is significant evidence that more women-owned establishments were created in the unorganized/informal sector. These new establishments were concentrated in industries where women entrepreneurs have been traditionally active and the entry was mainly found among household-based establishments. The paper measures and discusses the extent to which this heightened entrepreneurship is due to channels like greater finance access or heightened inspiration for women entrepreneurs.\", 'last_modified_date': '2013-02-13T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Gender,Water Resources,Finance and Financial Sector Development'}\n",

It estimates the effects of digital technology adoption, learning by exporting, and managerial experience on revenue-based total factor productivity and factor demand. The results reject the 0 hypothesis of an exogenous revenue-based total factor productivity process, in favor of one in which digital technology adoption, along with the other choice variables, affects revenue-based total factor productivity and factor demand. The estimated premiums are positive for 67.3 (email adoption), 54.6 (website adoption), 59.4 (learning by exporting), and 60.6 (managerial experience) percent of the sample. The probability-adjusted median (log) revenue-based total factor productivity premium associated with email adoption is 1.6 percent and that of website adoption is 2.2 percent, with the latter being higher than the premiums corresponding to exporting and managerial experience.

Existing evidence suggests that increased access to information technology has improved agricultural market efficiency for consumer markets and certain commodities, but there is less evidence of its impact on producer markets. Building on the work of Aker (2010), this paper estimates the impact of mobile phone coverage on producer price dispersion for three commodities in Niger. The results suggest that mobile phone coverage reduces spatial producer price dispersion by 6 percent for cowpea, a semi-perishable commodity. These effects are strongest for remote markets and during certain periods of the year. The introduction of mobile phone coverage has no effect on producer price dispersion for millet and sorghum, two staple grains that are less perishable and are commonly stored by farmers. There are no impacts of mobile phone coverage on traders' gross margins or producer price levels, but mobile phone coverage is associated with a reduction in the intra-annual price variation for cowpea. These results are potentially explained by the fact that farmers engage in greater storage for storable commodities such as millet and sorghum.\", 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Information and Communication Technologies,Informatics'}\n",

The first period, from 1950 to 1963, saw a growth in associational activity in the modern enclave of late colonial Aden and within the protectorates of the northern imamate amidst heavy immigration and modernization. A second stage of development took place in the late 1970s and 1980s with very little central control but exceptional affluence thanks to remittances from citizens employed in the Gulf. As the political transition in Yemen continues, there is renewed interest in engaging local Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) in the process of service delivery, decentralization, institution building and in encouraging inclusion and greater citizen participation. The Government has requested that the World Bank update its earlier work on CSOs in Yemen to map and to assess the capacities of present-day, development-oriented CSOs in five governorates. Nearly all of the CSOs that participated in this study were formally registered, non-governmental organizations that were generally independent of tribal or religious affiliation. There is an important opening in Yemen at present to encourage greater social accountability among CSOs and through CSO-Government partnerships. Social accountability includes a growing emphasis on beneficiary engagement in monitoring and assessing government performance as well as service providers, particularly in providing feedback on, and voicing demand for, improved service delivery. Based on this study's findings, it is recommended that the Government reform CSOs-related procedures, including registration, re-licensing, and decentralize avenues for CSO-ministry collaboration on service delivery and standards development to the governorate-level branches of the respective Ministries. Finally, it is recommended that training be made available for Yemeni journalists that cover the work of the country's civic sector or development issues in general.\", 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Governance,Public Sector Development,Social Development'}\n",

Governments in developing countries have a limited capacity to smooth the losses created by extreme weather, and could potentially benefit from the introduction of disaster funds, that is, ex-ante budgeting allocations for post-disaster reconstruction. So far the implementation of disaster funds has been limited, in part because it is still unclear whether disaster funds provide a cost-effective way of coping with these losses. By taking advantage of the sharp rules that govern the municipal-level eligibility for reconstruction funds in Mexico, this paper provides some of the first estimates of the impact of disaster funds on local economic activity. The main finding is that access to disaster funding boosts local economic activity between 2 and 4 percent in the year following the disaster. Another finding is that the positive impact of disaster funds on local economic recovery can persist for as long as a year and a half after the disaster. Consistent with these findings, we additionally show that access to disaster funding leads to a large and sustained 76 percent increase in the growth of local construction employment.

As for waterborne transport, sea and river ports and terminals form these nodal points where freight is transferred from one mode to another. Chapter one provides data on world maritime transport and explains the different types of cargo that pass which are carried by the world merchant fleet and the cargoes they carry. It also is explained that the former general cargo type of vessels have evolved into vessel designs that have specifically been designed for different types of cargoes. Chapter two provides an extensive overview of the development of the container in terms of what containers are, how dedicated container vessels have developed as well as the impact of containers on logistic processes, including hinterland connections. Chapter three provides an overview of the world port in terms of numbers and classifies the largest ports in the world in terms of total cargoes, containers and dry bulk. Chapter four presents an overview of the indicators used in ports. Chapter five describes how ports around the world are owned and managed. First the major characteristics and functions of ports are described and possible ownership structures are explained. The chapter six not only describes the aspect of emissions, but also describes other forms of pollution sources of the sector, as these are noise, light, dust and soil and water pollution. As is explained in chapter seven, port work has gradually changed from pure physical work to processing control using dedicated and complicated equipment and automated systems. Similarly, the work of seafarers has changed. Chapter eight provides tools as to how cities can cope with this issue; in particular how former port areas can be and have been re-integrated in the city.

To guide the empirical analysis, it develops a model of industry equilibrium in which heterogeneous firms decide between family and professional management when the latter are subject to contracting frictions. The paper tests the model's predictions using regional variation in trust within countries. Consistent with the model, the finding show that there is sorting of firms across management modes, in which smaller firms and those in regions with worse contracting environments are more likely to be family managed. These firms are on average 25 percent less productive than professionally managed firms, and moving from the country with the least reliable contracting environment to the most increases total factor productivity by 21.6 percent.

In particular, agricultural sector growth was better than feared with a slightly positive growth rate despite the worst monsoon shortfall in three decades. Strong growth in the fourth quarter pushed annual GDP growth to 7.4 percent in 2009-10. Fourth quarter growth reached 8.6 percent (y-o-y), the highest quarterly growth rate since the end of FY2007/08. The industrial sector's robust recovery beat expectations. Growth in the last quarter of fiscal year FY2009/10 was an unexpectedly high 13.3 percent resulting in over 12 percent growth in the second half of year, nearly double the 6 percent growth witnessed in the first half.

Previous studies have warned about the sustainability of such a decline, and this paper presents evidence of stagnation in the pace of reduction of income inequality in Latin America since 2010. This phenomenon of stagnation is robust to different measures of inequality and is largely attributable to the impact of the Global Financial Crisis on Mexico and Central America, where inequality rose after 2010 as labor income recovered. Moreover, this paper finds evidence that much of the continuation of inequality reduction after the crisis at the country level has been due to negative or zero income growth for households in the top of the income distribution, and lower growth of the incomes of the poorest households. The crisis also highlighted weaknesses in the region's labor markets and the heavy reliance on public transfers to redistribute, underscoring the vulnerability of the region's recent social gains to global economic conditions.\", 'last_modified_date': '2014-12-29T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Poverty Reduction,Social Protections and Labor,Industry,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth'}\n",

This paper analyzes the long-term effects on the welfare of the original participant households and their offspring, about 20 years after the inception of the program. To complement other studies that look into the effects on schooling and health, the analysis focuses on a utilitarian definition of welfare and employs two empirical strategies. The first uses the 1997-2000 experiment as the cleanest, albeit limited, source of variation. The analysis finds that by 2017–18, the offspring of original beneficiary households are more likely to have formed their own households, to have migrated to different localities, and to have more durable assets and larger consumption expenditures than their control counterpart. The second strategy confirms and expands those findings using a difference-in-difference methodology based on the localities' rollout of the program and the age of the individuals, as a proxy of exposure. This second approach covers a much larger and representative sample, while also directly observing self-reported vulnerability in food consumption. The findings confirm the generally positive outlook in terms of durable assets and lower food vulnerability. Perhaps more interestingly and relevant for evaluating the success of the program is that it improved intergenerational mobility.

In the context of a transition economy, accurately measuring the changes that are underway is difficult. The statistical system itself is in transition, and there are a wide range of activities that go unrecorded. Official statistics suggest that disparities among the regions have increased since the mid-1990s in Ukraine, and data also suggest that many of the regions in the west that focus on heavy industry, plus Kyiv, continue to have the strongest economic performance. In contrast, regions in the far west of the country have the lowest per capita gross value added (GVA). On reviewing regional development policy, some of the factors that may explain the lack of effectiveness are as follows: weak framework in setting objectives and priorities; no fiscal parameters; ad hoc allocation of investment; reliance on heavy state intervention; and, top-down versus bottom-up. In order to build a long-term base for regional development, and improve the effectiveness of policy in the short term, there are a number of steps to be taken as follows: there is need to clarify who is responsible for what in the development and implementation of regional policy; strengthen the Concept of Regional Policy, to more clearly specify the broad targets of the Government's regional policy and the particular aspects of the central government's role; develop administrative structures over time, but don't tie regional development entirely to these structures; address issues related to disparities in basic services through equalization transfers, and safety nets; and, strengthen the financial accountability, and after this, the ability of regions to raise revenues.

It covers evaluation of lending and non-lending services, dissemination and use of evaluation findings, initiatives in support of evaluation capacity development in borrowing member countries, OED\\'s resource use, and the evaluation record of the International Finance Corporation\\'s Operations Evaluation Unit. Fiscal year 1994 was the first full year of the implemenation of a strategy by OED to respond to the recommendations made by the Portfolio Management Task Force (PMTF) and by the Joint Audit Committee in its report on \"Portfolio Managemment and the Evaluation Function.\" Finally, this report addresses the specific areas of the Next Steps action program, where OED had a role to play.', 'last_modified_date': '2014-12-02T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Gender,Transport,Information and Communication Technologies,Agriculture,Poverty Reduction'}\n",

Together with a handful of other countries, Ghana offers the opportunity to analyze the distributional changes in the past two decades, since four comparable household surveys are available. In addition, different from many other countries in the continent, Ghana’s rapid growth translated into fast poverty reduction. A closer look at the distributional changes that occurred in the same period, however, suggests less optimism. The present paper develops an innovative methodology to analyze the distributional changes that occurred and their drivers, with a high degree of accuracy and granularity. Looking at the results from 1991 to 2012, the paper documents how the distributional changes hollowed out the middle of the Ghanaian household consumption distribution and increased the concentration of households around the highest and lowest deciles; there was a clear surge in polarization indeed. When looking at the drivers of polarization, household characteristics, educational attainment, and access to basic infrastructure all tended to increase over time the size of the upper and lower tails of the consumption distribution and, as a consequence, the degree of polarization.', 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Social Protections and Labor,Education,Poverty Reduction'}\n",

Using a panel of high and middle-income countries over the period 1980-2010, this paper provides empirical evidence that the credit-to-GDP ratio is inappropriate to measure equilibrium credit. The reason for this is that such an approach ignores heterogeneity in the parameters that determine equilibrium credit across countries due to different stages of economic development. The main drivers of this heterogeneity are financial depth, access to financial services, use of capital markets, efficiency and funding of domestic banks, central bank independence, the degree of supervisory integration, and experience of a financial crisis.

The causality between inflation and MWs proved important in all the countries, except Argentina.

In particular, they decompose the fall in international trade into product entry and exit, price changes, and quantity changes for imports by Brazil, the European Union, Indonesia, and the United States. When the authors aggregate across all products, most of the countries analyzed experienced a decline in new products, a rise in product exit, and falls in quantity for product lines that continued to be traded. The evidence suggests that the intensive rather than extensive margin mattered the most, consistent with studies of other countries and previous recessionary periods. On average, quantities declined and prices fell. However, these average effects mask enormous differences across different products. Price declines were driven primarily by commodities. Within manufacturing, while most quantity changes were negative, in most cases price changes moved in the opposite direction. Consequently, within manufacturing, there is some evidence consistent with the hypothesis that supply side frictions played a role.

The report looks at only the simplest dimensions of project-financed research and examines research outcomes of only a few projects. Among conclusions tentatively reached: (1) more than 90 percent of PHN projects from fiscal years 1980-91 financed research. (2) Bank experience with project-financed research in the PHN sector has been extremely variable: quite successful in some countries and almost a total failure in others.

(3) Personalities make a difference, both among borrowers and within the Bank. Often successes are associated with a particular person within the government or the Bank who has taken a continuing personal interest in encouraging research. (4) Supervision is crucial to good results. Supervision must be frequent enough to keep the research component on time and of good quality. For quality research to be completed, it is important that those responsible for supervision attach a high priority to research even if it is not a large part of the project in terms of budget. (5) Research that leads to a project outcome - such as research needed to justify release of funds or for a follow-on project - is more likely to be undertaken and completed than is research with a more general objective.

Moreover, this paper finds evidence that much of the continuation of inequality reduction after the crisis at the country level has been due to negative or zero income growth for households in the top of the income distribution, and lower growth of the incomes of the poorest households.

This paper analyzes the long-term effects on the welfare of the original participant households and their offspring, about 20 years after the inception of the program. To complement other studies that look into the effects on schooling and health, the analysis focuses on a utilitarian definition of welfare and employs two empirical strategies. The first uses the 1997-2000 experiment as the cleanest, albeit limited, source of variation. The analysis finds that by 2017–18, the offspring of original beneficiary households are more likely to have formed their own households, to have migrated to different localities, and to have more durable assets and larger consumption expenditures than their control counterpart. The second strategy confirms and expands those findings using a difference-in-difference methodology based on the localities' rollout of the program and the age of the individuals, as a proxy of exposure. This second approach covers a much larger and representative sample, while also directly observing self-reported vulnerability in food consumption. The findings confirm the generally positive outlook in terms of durable assets and lower food vulnerability. Perhaps more interestingly and relevant for evaluating the success of the program is that it improved intergenerational mobility. Using the 1997-2000 experiment, the analysis finds that the young adults who benefited from the program improved with respect to their parents in education, assets holding, and income.

Intended populations for different types of post disaster support vary and are often constrained by fiscal space and resource availability. Rapid increase of SP benefits to existing beneficiaries has been a common and useful SP response to support poor and vulnerable households affected by a shock. However, while LAC exhibits comparatively high coverage of SP programs among the total population and the poorest quintile when compared to other regions, there are still large coverage gaps, particularly in some countries. This further constrains rapid provision of SP benefits to non-beneficiaries or deploying emergency safety nets to affected households. Furthermore, existing SP beneficiaries are not the only persons in need of support in post-disaster contexts, as disasters often push near-poor individuals and households into poverty. This guidance note shares country experiences and provides solutions for effectively assessing post-disaster needs and conditions to inform the provision of post-disaster social protection benefits and services.', 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Poverty Reduction,Social Protections and Labor'}\n",
            "{'id': '29805040', 'abstract': 'Mitigation of greenhouse gases in the land sector is complex and has a unique set of challenges. The most significant challenges arise from the geographically diffuse nature of the emissions sources (compared to, for example, point-based energy sources of emissions), the vast array of potential management responses, the ongoing effects of past actions, the interaction of human and natural processes, and the strong influences of policy and markets. These factors result in a large number and diversity of actors involved, temporal variability in emissions sources and volumes, and higher uncertainty associated with the processes generating the emission reductions. Because of this, achieving large-scale mitigation in the land sector requires collective action involving multiple stakeholders undertaking different activities. This paper synthesizes several lessons learned in efforts to develop systems that integrate incentive mechanisms at multiple scales. It illustrates many lessons through examples and the appendix presents individual case studies from a variety of geographies, Acre (state in Brazil), Australia, Brazil (Amazon), the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Guatemala, and Zambia. The hope is that the experiences of emerging ‘nested’ systems can provide inspiration to countries developing REDD systems, particularly those which seek to catalyze across a landscape local actions that contribute to national mitigation. The objective of this paper is to share a few lessons from nested systems. While there are many positive benefits to nesting, experience suggests that countries struggle with development of nested systems. Very few have been operationalized (with exception to a few developed countries, such as Australia and New Zealand), although several REDD nested systems are now emerging. Section two explores four high-level ‘typologies’ that countries may consider when developing a nested system. Section three summarizes three key technical challenges that countries face: alignment of measurement systems, reference levels, and double counting. Both sections illustrate options using real-world examples from countries pioneering nested approaches and explain why certain choices were made. The paper concludes with thoughts on overall lessons learned, recognizing that the journey is still young.', 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Science and Technology Development,Health, Nutrition and Population,Agriculture,Water Resources,Energy,Rural Development,Environment'}\n",

This paper decomposes trade costs into three categories: costs that can be lowered by trade facilitation, nontariff barriers, and the costs of business services. The paper develops a 10-region, 18-sector, global trade model that includes Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and Rwanda of the East African Customs Union. The analysis finds that deep integration in the East African Customs Union that lowers these trade costs results in significant gains for the four countries, especially from improved trade facilitation. Extending the lowering of nontariff barriers and services liberalization multilaterally would increase the gains between two and seven times, depending on the country. that the analysis also finds that reducing nondiscriminatory services barriers in Kenya and Tanzania would increase welfare even more than multilateral reduction of discriminatory services barriers. The paper is innovative both conceptually and empirically. It contains foreign direct investment in services and is the first paper to numerically assess liberalization of barriers against domestic and multinational service providers in a multi-sector, multi-region, applied general equilibrium model.

Bearing in mind that more than 90 percent of the world trade in tons per year is transported by sea and against the background of increasing ship sizes (especially in the container trade) and continuously growing globalization, the requirements for adequate and secure port facilities and the resulting logistics challenges are accelerating worldwide. The International Ship and Port Facility Security Code (ISPS code) is a comprehensive set of measures to enhance the security of ships and port facilities and came into force on the July 1, 2004. The ISPS code is implemented through chapter XI-2 special measures to enhance maritime security in the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS). The code has two parts, one mandatory (part A) and one recommendatory (part B). Compliance is mandatory for the 148 contracting parties to SOLAS; detailed implementation of the code is a matter for the individual national governments. The introduction of the ISPS Code has led to many questions and misunderstandings. The code does not, as will have been useful, prescribe in exact terms and data what port facility and port managers have to do or provide to ensure that they are compliant. Part A of the ISPS code actually is a type of questionnaire that asks questions about security items, but then stops short of giving exact and uniform instructions as to how the specific measures can be established. A simple example is the fencing of the port facility. The ISPS code describes that the port facility has to be fenced adequately so as to prevent illegal intruders from entering the facility. But the code does not describe the type of fence, its height and so on. This has led to situations in which a port authority considered its fence adequate, but found out later that other entities, such as security consultants or the United States (US) Coast Guard, did not fully agree with this, and sometimes even not at all. The ISO (International Organization for Standardization) has made an attempt to translate the ISPS Code in a type of handbook, but the result in fact was another questionnaire.', 'last_modified_date': '2018-03-18T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Industry,Private Sector Development,Transport'}\n",

Despite their valuable contributions to people's sustenance, environmental stability and the strengthening of private resource based farming systems, they are neglected by researchers, policy makers and development planners alike. Disregard of CPRs and their productive potential is a major missing dimension of rural development strategies in developing countries and reflects much of the officialdom's indifference to environmental protection. This is illustrated by the status and changes in CPRs in the dry tropical regions of India, where not only are CPRs not integrated into rural development strategies but they are prone to rapid degradation largely induced by side effects of other development and welfare policies. The paper argues that due to the convergence between potential CPR-centered policies or programs and the emerging concerns for participatory development, environmental sustainability and poverty alleviation, CPRs could be made an effective component of rural development strategies in areas such as dry regions of India. The paper reports and analyzes the empirical findings from a study of CPRs conducted by the author during the 1980s. Based on four years of field work covering 82 villages in over 20 districts of India's dry region, the study has quantified the benefits of CPRs in terms of employment, income and physical supplies, and has recorded some less quantifiable contributions.\", 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Poverty Reduction'}\n",

The paper finds a limited role of changes in distortions over time in accounting for actual growth. Implied growth from changes in distortions accounts for less than 2.5 percent of actual growth for the median country. To check if the lower contribution of changes in distortions is because of unrealized gains suggested by high levels of present distortions, productivity gains are estimated when distortions across countries are reduced to the US levels.

As noted previously, the institutional elements of the formal financial sector in Rwanda are in place but the levels of financial inclusion are still low. The government pension scheme covers less than 3 percent of the population, and the voluntary private pension funds cover less than 1 percent. The new Pensions Law in Rwanda introduced a comprehensive regulation of the private pension funds, providing a basis for sound consumer protection and opening opportunities for growth, and yet some CPFL issues still need to be addressed. The securities market lists only 7 equities and 9 bonds, capitalized at 27 percent of GDP. The 2011 laws on capital markets regulation introduced a sound regulatory framework that is not yet complete nonetheless and requires stronger investor protection. The key findings and recommendations of the Review – presented in Volume 1 of 2 – detail the main CPFL challenges and the suggested high priority remedies.

In terms of method, the analysis relies on simulations with a Pakistani version of MAMS (Maquette for MDG Simulations), a Computable General Equilibrium model developed at the World Bank for country strategy analysis. The different policy scenarios point to the importance of selecting infrastructure projects with high productivity effects and the crucial role of financing in determining the net effects of expanded government infrastructure spending. Transfer programs can generate immediate welfare gains but are less effective over time unless they are designed to raise productivity, perhaps via improvements in health, nutrition, and education outcomes. A final high-growth scenario explores requirements and consequences for Pakistan's economy if, during the period 2013-2022, it managed to raise its rate of annual GDP growth from the 4-5 percent range to 7 percent. The results for the final scenario indicate that rapid growth acceleration may be achieved via a combination of strong increases in savings, investment and total factor productivity. By 2022, 10 years of growth at a rate of 7 percent would spread across the macro demand indicators as well as the major production sectors. Its effects would include significant, broader gains in terms of poverty reduction and better outcomes for indicators.\", 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Private Sector Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Finance and Financial Sector Development'}\n",

Although there has been a modest convergence in mobility rates of non-SC/ST and SC/ST men in educational attainment, there has been no significant convergence in the mobility rates of occupational attainment. Upward mobility of SC/ST men remains much lower compared to non-SC/ST men. Additionally, the former are more susceptible than the latter to moving down the intergenerational ladder. The mobility gap varies over a large range across states, but the cross-state variation has declined, with convergence being higher in states with larger gaps initially.

Previous empirical work suggests the entry of a joint-liability lender may lead to a positive impact on the informal lending rate.

Households in rural Bihar, India, were offered low-cost credit through a government-led self-help group program, the rollout of which was randomized at the panchayat level. The intervention led to a dramatic 14.5 percent decline in the use of informal credit, as households substituted to lower-cost self-help group loans. Due to the program, the average rate paid on recent loans fell from 69 to 58 percent per year overall. Rates on informal loans also declined slightly. Among landless households, informal lending rates fell from 65.5 to 63.2 percent, decreasing by 40 percent the gap in rates paid by landless versus landowning households. Two years after the initiation of the program, significant positive impacts on asset ownership among landless households were apparent. Impacts on various indicators of women's empowerment were mixed, and showed no clear direction when aggregated, nor was there any impact on consumption expenditures.\", 'last_modified_date': '2017-04-03T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Poverty Reduction'}\n",

The results suggest that goal-setting has a significant, positive impact on students' time use, study effort, and self-discipline. However, there are no significant impacts on test scores. This is partially because nearly two-thirds of the students do not set realistic goals. The paper finds that the effects on time use, study effort, and discipline are weaker when goal setting is combined with nonfinancial rewards. This suggests that tying goal setting to extrinsic incentives could weaken its impact. The results show stronger impacts for female students and from students from weaker socioeconomic backgrounds.

However, the costs and processes of formality may be too challenging for firms, particularly the smallest firms, to bear. Thus, informal firms may not be able to survive the transition to formality and attempts to expand formality may be harmful and counterproductive to job creation and growth. This paper investigates the potential for currently informal firms to formalize in the Arab Republic of Egypt. The paper compares the characteristics and dynamics of micro and small non-agricultural firms by formality and identifies the extent of overlap and potential for formalization. The analysis finds that, beyond firm size, the basic and easily observable characteristics of firms are not closely linked to formality. Firm age, productivity, and owner characteristics such as education are strongly predictive of formality. There is some overlap in the predicted probability of formality between formal and informal firms, suggesting some potential for formalization. The paper develops profiles (groups and clusters) of similar firms to identify those with a higher potential for formalization. In terms of dynamics, new firms tend to be informal and informal firms are more likely to exit (close), but conditional on firm survival, employment growth is similar across formal and informal firms.', 'last_modified_date': '2020-10-05T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Social Protections and Labor,Education,Poverty Reduction,Transport'}\n",

There is also broad agreement that a higher level of investment in a country is conducive to a higher rate of economic growth (other things being equal), though the exact relationship depends on a number of institutional and other factors.

They show that there is a main effect that tends to cause this relationship to be positive, and that there can be secondary effects that can either rein-force or oppose (or even overbalance) the main effect. They test the theory using the World Val-ues Survey as a source of proxies for morality. Using their preferred proxy, they find evidence that higher within-country correlation between morality and ability, holding constant the levels of morality and ability, increases per-capita income levels. Under the preferred specification, a one-standard-deviation increase in the correlation between morality and ability raises the log of per-capita income by about one-fourth of a standard deviation, equal to approximately $3,600 for the median income country in the sample. The results are robust to correcting for endogeneity and to changes in sample and specification.

            "{'id': '16812612', 'abstract': 'Firms have various ways to cope with external risks. This paper analyzes the risk coping behavior that entails the smoothing of inputs (labor, raw materials, or capital). The theoretical framework shows that, if they face adjustment costs, firms prefer to smooth their inputs, especially if they expect a demand shock to be temporary. However, credit constrained firms will be adversely affected by the presence of liquidity constraints, and this will create a welfare loss due to incomplete smoothing. The authors estimate this behavior using a panel of Cambodian firms at the time of the 2008 global economic crisis. The survey shows that these firms were hard hit by the economic crisis between 2008 and 2009, with an average fall in demand (sales) of 30 percent. Based on the theoretical framework, the analysis can estimate the responsiveness of labor, capital, and raw materials input demand to demand shocks. It finds that firms try to smooth in particular if they believe the shock is temporary; in fact non-credit constrained firms reduce their inputs much less than firms that were credit constrained when the demand shock is expected to be temporary. The paper estimates that the welfare loss from incomplete smoothing due to credit constraints is many multiples of the adjustment costs of the firms that were not credit constrained. This has important policy implications about the role of financial sector development and regulations beyond the capital market. This micro analysis also has macro implications: if all firms expect a shock to be permanent, their combined limited smoothing of inputs will indeed make the shock more likely to be permanent.', 'last_modified_date': '2012-10-09T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Social Protections and Labor,Finance and Financial Sector Development'}\n",

This paper asks which leaders matter and develops a methodology to estimate the growth contribution of individual leaders and calculate its precision. The findings show that few leaders have statistically significant contributions; it is difficult to know who is good for growth and who is not. The paper also finds that the most intuitive estimate of a leader's contribution -- the average growth rate during tenure -- is largely useless for measuring his or her true contribution. Consequently, many leaders with statistically significant growth effects are surprises. Moreover, leaders in non-democratic countries are no more likely to be statistically significant than leaders in democratic ones.\", 'last_modified_date': '2020-04-20T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Industry,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Conflict and Development,International Economics and Trade,Education'}\n",

Global economic activity continued to decline in the first part of 2009, even as tentative signs of stabilization have emerged recently in several countries. However, very expansionary fiscal and monetary policies have kept the economy growing respectably. Fiscal stimulus is centered on the infrastructure-oriented 'RMB 4 trillion' stimulus plan and the monetary stimulus has led to a surge in new bank lending. Government-influenced investment has soared. Market-based investment has lagged, although positive signs have emerged in the real estate sector. Consumption has held up well. Very weak exports have continued to be the main drag on growth, but import volumes have recovered in the second quarter of 2009 as raw material imports rebounded. One reason is that the fiscal deficit is likely to be significantly higher than budgeted and additional stimulus now reduces the room for stimulus in 2010. Nonetheless, with subdued global demand and less export growth, China needs more growth from domestic demand, consumption in particular. Also, relative prices need to change, notably those of natural resources. The transition to more consumption-led, service sector-oriented, and labor-intensive growth requires policy adjustments that: (i) help channel resources to sectors that will grow in the new setting, instead of to sectors that have traditionally done well; and (ii) support thriving domestic markets and successful, permanent urbanization. Such reforms can be pursued more successfully if flanked by a well-functioning public finance system and social safety net.\", 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Private Sector Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Finance and Financial Sector Development'}\n",

This paper explores the application of \"wavelet-based\" techniques to study the time-varying nature of growth and volatility. These techniques lend themselves to a more robust analysis of short-term and long-term determinants of growth and volatility than the traditional decomposition techniques, as demonstrated on a small sample of countries. In addition to having desirable technical advantages, such as localization in time and frequency and the ability to work with non-stationary series, these techniques also make it possible to accurately decompose the association between growth trajectories of different countries over different time horizons.

Identification comes from a large spatial difference in within-village temporal changes in refugee intensity, following a recent upsurge in the flow of refugees into the country. The findings reveal different implications depending on the type of household welfare metric. While reducing consumption expenditure per capita and increasing the probability of falling into consumption poverty, hosting refugees has no effect on wealth and the status of wealth poverty. Decomposing consumption expenditure per capita into food, education, and other nonfood components, the results further reveal that hosting refugees alters the composition of consumption, as it solely affects food consumption expenditure. The consumption effects prevail in rural areas with no effects in urban centers while no heterogeneity is found concerning wealth and wealth poverty results. Key mechanisms explaining the adverse consumption effects include displacement of hosts from salaried employment and a spike in prices of agricultural inputs but not changes in the extent of societal cooperation.', 'last_modified_date': '2021-04-06T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Social Development,Social Protections and Labor,Conflict and Development,Rural Development,Education,Poverty Reduction'}\n",

This paper presents a framework to quantify how much initial conditions affect poverty reduction, given a level of \"effort\" (growth). The framework used in the analysis allows for the growth elasticity of poverty to vary according to changes in the income distribution along the dynamic path of growth and redistribution, unlike previous examples in the literature where this is assumed to be constant. While wealthier countries did perform better in reducing poverty in the last decade and a half (1995-2008), assuming equal initial conditions, the situation reverses: the paper finds a statistically significant negative relation between initial average income and poverty reduction performance, with the poorest countries in the sample going from the worst to the best performers in poverty reduction. The analysis also quantifies how much poorer countries would have scored better, had they had the same level of initial average income as wealthier countries. The results suggest a remarkable change in poverty reduction performance, in addition to the reversal of ranks from worst to best performers. The application of this framework goes beyond poverty targets and the Millennium Development Goals. Given the widespread use of targets to determine resource allocation in education, health, or decentralized social expenditures, it constitutes a helpful tool to measure policy performance toward all kinds of goals. The proposed framework can be useful to evaluate the importance of initial conditions on outcomes, for a wide array of policies.', 'last_modified_date': '2013-02-13T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Poverty Reduction'}\n",

The initiative sent a series of informational messages to about 5.5 million mobile phone subscribers and reached at least one member of more than 90 percent of the country’s households. An individual fixed effects estimator is used to measure changes in reported behavior after a respondent lists text messages as a primary source of information about COVID-19, or alternatively when reporting an official text message in the past week. Listing text messaging as a primary source of information increased the number of reported behaviors by 0.15 units (p = 0.000) and receiving an official text message in the past week increased the number by 0.47 units (p = 0.000). These effects were driven by more positive responses for wearing masks, reducing visits with friends and relatives, reducing travel, practicing safer greetings (such as fewer handshakes), and safety-related changes at work. The results suggest that text messaging–based public health messaging was a cost-effective means of increasing awareness in a large and geographically dispersed audience during the COVID-19 pandemic and that the program led to an increase in self-reported risk reducing behaviors.', 'last_modified_date': 'N/A', 'teratopic': 'Industry,Information and Communication Technologies,Health, Nutrition and Population'}\n",

Some recent studies have found that the support of these agencies has been effective with respect to the intensive and extensive margins of trade. Nevertheless, because of the lack of information on non-exporting firms, few of them analyze their impact on the probability of promoting new exporters. This paper evaluates the impact of the Brazilian Trade and Investment Promotion Agency (Apex-Brasil) on firms' export status using a unique firm-level dataset that covers the full manufacturing sector in Brazil. To identify the impact of Apex's assistance on firms' export propensity, the paper relies on a procedure of matching difference-in-difference estimators. The empirical results show evidence of the program's positive impact on the probability of promoting new exporters. The effect is heterogeneous according to firms' size categories and sectors. Furthermore, the findings suggest that the program has spillover effects. Although the evidence of positive effect is robust, the low propensity to export for both the treated and the control groups reinforces the importance of other firms' determinants (for example, productivity), which is widely emphasized by the trade literature.\", 'last_modified_date': '2015-09-02T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'International Economics and Trade'}\n",
            "{'id': '29957686', 'abstract': \"Languages use different systems for classifying nouns. Gender languages assign many -- sometimes all -- nouns to distinct sex-based categories, masculine and feminine. Drawing on a broad range of historical and linguistic sources, this paper constructs a measure of the proportion of each country's population whose native language is a gender language. At the cross-country level, this paper documents a robust negative relationship between the prevalence of gender languages and women's labor force participation. It also shows that traditional views of gender roles are more common in countries with more native speakers of gender languages. In African countries where indigenous languages vary in terms of their gender structure, educational attainment and female labor force participation are lower among those whose native languages are gender languages. Cross-country and individual-level differences in labor force participation are large in both absolute and relative terms (when women are compared to men), suggesting that the observed patterns are not driven by development or some unobserved aspect of culture that affects men and women equally. Following the procedures proposed by Altonji, Elder, and Taber (2005) and Oster (2017), this paper shows that the observed correlations are unlikely to be driven by unobservables. Using a permutation test based on the structure of the language tree and the distribution of languages across countries, this paper demonstrates that the results are not driven by spurious correlations within language families. Gender languages appear to reduce women's labor force participation and perpetuate support for unequal treatment of women.\", 'last_modified_date': '2018-06-14T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Social Protections and Labor,Poverty Reduction,Culture and Development,Gender,Education'}\n",

Another group sees little value to research for their work and does not bother to find out about it. Higher perceived value is reflected in greater knowledge about research, though there are frictions in this process.

The main conclusion of the paper is that Brazil could gain significantly from opening to foreign trade.

The improvement was largely heterogeneous; in mathematics, performance improved more for students already performing well, while the opposite was the case for science, where students at the bottom of the score distribution experienced a spectacular increase in science scores. Most of the increase in scores for both mathematics and science is explained by over-time changes in coefficients (and a smaller part by improvements in characteristics). Contributors not accounted for (and therefore captured by changes in the constant) dominate the effects of the coefficients. One potentially important piece of information missing from the Ghana data is whether a school is private or public; this could potentially explain part of the over-time improvement. This is because over the short period between the two surveys, there was a large increase in the number of private schools in Ghana (by 36 percent between 2005/6 and 2007/8). Finally, an analysis of the over-time change in the test score gap by location (between large and small communities) revealed that the gap became more heterogeneous, narrowing for worse performing students and widening for better performing students.', 'last_modified_date': '2012-06-11T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Education'}\n",

The paper provides an impressionistic and non-comprehensive review of mixed-methods relevant to development economics and discrimination to illustrate these points.', 'last_modified_date': '2022-01-28T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Law and Development,Gender,Social Development,Information and Communication Technologies'}\n",

Recent work on least-cost diets has focused on individuals, while most food and anti-poverty programs and policies target the household level. Members within households have differing nutritional needs, presenting the methodological question: how should the cost of nutritious diets be estimated at the household level This study develops bounds on the cost, affordability, and seasonal variation of least-cost diets for whole households, illustrated with the example of Malawi. When intrahousehold sharing is not possible to observe, the bounded approach provides insights into the range of the cost and affordability, and the extent to which the cost may vary seasonally. The results reveal that when meals are shared, ignoring demographic diversity within households greatly underestimates the affordability of adequate diets.', 'last_modified_date': '2021-11-03T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Energy,Poverty Reduction,Industry,Health, Nutrition and Population'}\n",
            "{'id': '18730827', 'abstract': 'This paper studies the relationship between inequality of opportunity and development outcomes in a cross-country setting. Scholars have long debated the impact of inequality on growth, development, and the quality of institutions in a society. The empirical relationships are however confounded by the notion that \"inequality\" can be seen as a composite of inequality arising from differences in effort and ability, which would tend to encourage competition and productivity, and inequality attributable to unequal opportunities, particularly in terms of access to basic goods and services, which might translate to wasted human potential and lower levels of development. The analysis in this paper applies a measure of educational opportunities that incorporates inequality between \"types\" or circumstance groups. Theories from economic history are used to instrument for this type of inequality in a large cross-country dataset. The results seem to confirm the hypothesis that this measure of inequality of opportunity is a better fit for structural inequality than the Gini index of income. The results suggest that inequality of endowments at the outset of history led to unequal educational opportunities, which in turn affected development outcomes such as institutional quality, infant mortality, and economic growth. The findings are robust to several checks on the instrumental variable specification.', 'last_modified_date': '2014-06-03T00:00:00Z', 'teratopic': 'Information and Communication Technologies,Poverty Reduction,Health, Nutrition and Population,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth'}\n",

An emergency operation can create opportunities for medium- to longer-term policy dialogue and more sustained engagement on institutional development, especially if the project performs well and justifies continued support either through additional financing or follow-on operations. Opportunistic inclusion of related activities can be beneficial for the purpose of experimentation and for opening new areas of policy dialogue and operational engagements.

Erosion prevention, erosion control techniques, and revegetation will also be applied. Application of wetland and stream crossing techniques will mitigate the risks of scouring and bank erosion. To minimize sedimentation in water bodies and disturbance to wetland areas, controlled procedures for wetland and water body crossings will be implemented. Wells will be properly cased to avoid aquifer interaction. Spill prevention will reduce the potential of groundwater contamination. Reduction in surface water availability will be minimized by calculating surface flow and withdrawal rate and volume. Surface water contamination can be prevented by proper disposal of hazardous materials. Vegetation clearing will be restricted to designated areas to reduce elimination of forest canopy.

It also contains an analysis of the CIS countries\\' trade potential and its realization in a comparative perspective, as well as examination of the nature of the existing CIS intra-bloc trade. The study revealed no evidence that the CIS countries as a group underperform significantly in terms of either trade openness or export levels when compared to the countries of similar per capita GDP and population size. This means, however, that the low-income economies in the CIS (CIS-7) have been performing on average just marginally better than other low-income countries and that, overall, they have been falling behind the countries that benefit most from globalization. Overall, progress in the trade area was slower in the CIS-7 countries than in the higher income CIS members. This is reflected in: (i) lower overall export levels and slower export growth in the second half of the 1990s; (ii) higher trade deficits; (iii) lower share of manufacturing exports; (iv) incomplete re-orientation of trade flows from the CIS to global markets; and (v) lower incidence of intra-industry trade. The study found that the CIS free trade area is, on balance, a beneficial, trade-facilitating bloc. It features a free trade regime, agreements on mutual recognition of standards, and non-restrictive rules of origin. There is no evidence so far that the CIS integration is of the \"South-South\" type and thus may be harmful for some of its members. However, the potential benefits of CIS trade integration remain badly underutilized.

Specifically, it assesses potential opportunities and challenges of improving digital government and open data initiatives in the country. Although DGRA and ODRA are two separate assessments with different dimensions evaluated, they take a similar methodological approach from a broader point of view, starting with the desk research and later expanding to scoping mission. Therefore, both chapters of DGRA and ODRA are similar in format but outlined in respective assessment dimension and individual indicators. Since its onset in the fall of 2017, intensive desk research was conducted, and a field mission was carried out to confirm preliminary findings and uncover additional insight during a specific period in time, which means that during the course of analysis and writing additional developments could have been made. This is similar to the United Nations global e-government development report, which assesses progress during a “snapshot” in time.DGRA, the first part of the report, aims to evaluate Vietnam’s current potential for digital government development across seven key dimensions of leadership and governance; user focus; business process change; capabilities; culture and skills; shared infrastructure; data driven; and cybersecurity, privacy and resilience. Meanwhile, ODRA assesses Vietnam’s open data policy through evaluating eight different dimensions of leadership; policy/legal framework; institutional structure; data within government; demand; citizen engagement; funding; and infrastructure.The DGRA chapter focuses on digital government, which is a core part of Digital Economy as public sector delivers information and services more effectively and make them accessible to its citizens.The DGRA also measures the citizen’s demand for digital government services as well as integration and infrastructure policies to delve deeper into the opportunities and challenges the country faces in its digital development journey. The assessment includes a step-by-step analysis of specific components of digital government and presents an action plan to address the challenges identified for improvement.ODRA, the second part of the report, focuses on the country’s open data policy. Open data refers that the data must be both legally and technically open to public, thus placed in the public domain or under liberal terms of use with minimal restrictions, and that the data is published in machine-readable and preferably in non-proprietary electronic formats, which enables everyone to access and use data with freely available software tools.This report, bringing DGRA and ODRA assessments altogether, aims to help raise awareness of digital government and open data, two critical topics as Vietnam prepares its next step for the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0). Further, it hopes to serve as a useful resource for the top government leadership in identifying areas of relative strengths and weaknesses to help improve digital government and open data at the same time.',\n",
